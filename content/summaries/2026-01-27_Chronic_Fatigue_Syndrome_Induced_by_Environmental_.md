## Summary

This study establishes a critical link between humidifier disinfectant exposure and the development of ME/CFS through a dual human and animal research model. By identifying specific mitochondrial damage and neuroinflammation as primary mechanisms, it validates toxic environmental exposure as a potential trigger for the disease. These findings provide a biological basis for symptoms in affected populations and offer new avenues for diagnosing ME/CFS via mitochondrial biomarkers.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the mechanistic link between exposure to humidifier disinfectants containing polyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate 💊 (PHMG-p) and the onset of ME/CFS. It specifically focused on how this chemical affects mitochondrial morphology, energy production, and neural health in the brain.

## Why was it researched?

Large-scale human casualties in South Korea were linked to humidifier disinfectants, with many survivors developing chronic fatigue symptoms. Researchers aimed to determine if PHMG-p directly causes ME/CFS pathology through systemic toxic effects.

## How was it researched?

The researchers analyzed mitochondrial abnormalities in the blood cells of human patients with disinfectant-linked ME/CFS. They further validated these findings by exposing mice to PHMG-p via intratracheal administration and assessing their behavior, mitochondrial function, and brain tissue integrity.

## What has been found?

Patients and exposed mice exhibited significant mitochondrial swelling, disrupted cristae, and reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex expression. Additionally, the researchers observed blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroglial activation, and glymphatic system dysfunction in the hypothalamus of the exposed mice.

## Discussion

The study successfully bridges the gap between environmental toxicology and clinical ME/CFS symptoms. While the animal model uses a specific administration route, the consistent mitochondrial findings across species strengthen the evidence for a shared pathological pathway.

## Conclusion & Future Work

PHMG-p acts as a potent environmental trigger for ME/CFS by inducing mitochondrial and neurological dysfunction. Future research should explore whether stabilizing mitochondrial function can reverse these toxic effects in affected patients.
