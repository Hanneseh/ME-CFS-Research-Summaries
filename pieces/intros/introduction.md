# ME/CFS Research Summaries

[Deutsche Version](README-de.md)

## Introduction

This repository provides summaries of key research publications on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID. The goal is to offer a transparent, chronological overview of the scientific progress for patients, caregivers, and their families.

Motivated by a close family member with severe ME/CFS, I monitor new research using PubMed and Google alerts. Promising studies are summarized using a custom AI agent and then manually reviewed for relevance before being added to the list below. You can search this page for the ðŸ’Š emoji to find all mentions of medications and substances being researched.

To help readers keep up with the latest developments, I regularly compile research roundups that highlight major trends, breakthroughs, and shifts in the field. These roundups provide context and connect individual studies into a broader narrative. You can find the roundups by searching for the ðŸŽ¯ emoji.

I've made this repository, along with the AI prompts, public so you can follow the progress yourself. If you believe an important study is missing or wish to contribute, please open an Issue or a Pull Request.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. The summaries may contain errors or omissions, including those introduced by AI-generated content. No responsibility is taken for factual inaccuracies. This is not a comprehensive or exhaustive list of all published research on ME/CFS or related conditions. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis
