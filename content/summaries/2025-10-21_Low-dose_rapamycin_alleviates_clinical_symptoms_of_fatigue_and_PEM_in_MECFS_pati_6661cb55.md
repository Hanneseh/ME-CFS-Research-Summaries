## Summary

This pilot study provides preliminary but promising evidence for a new treatment target in ME/CFS. It suggests that a subgroup of patients may have symptoms driven by an overactive mTOR pathway and a stalled cellular cleaning process (autophagy). The use of low-dose rapamycin 💊, an existing FDA-approved drug, to correct this issue resulted in significant symptom improvement for many in the trial, particularly in fatigue and PEM. This research is important because it not only tests a potential therapy but also provides clinical evidence for a specific biological mechanism (mTOR-driven autophagy impairment) in the disease. The biomarkers used, BECLIN-1 and pSer258-ATG13, could become crucial tools for developing diagnostic tests to identify which patients might benefit from this type of treatment in the future. However, these are early findings from a small, uncontrolled study, and more rigorous, placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the drug's safety and effectiveness.

## What was researched?

This pilot study investigated the safety and efficacy of low-dose rapamycin 💊 in patients with ME/CFS. The primary goal was to determine if this treatment could alleviate core symptoms like fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) by improving autophagy, a cellular cleaning and recycling process.

## Why was it researched?

The study was prompted by previous findings that ME/CFS is associated with chronic inflammation and impaired autophagy, both of which may be linked to the over-activation of a cellular pathway called mTOR. Since rapamycin 💊 is a well-known mTOR inhibitor , researchers hypothesized it could restore the autophagy process and, in turn, improve the clinical symptoms of ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This was a decentralized, uncontrolled, observational pilot study involving 86 ME/CFS patients who initiated therapy. Participants were administered a low dose of rapamycin 💊, which was gradually increased to a target of 6 mg/week. Clinical symptoms were assessed using self-reported questionnaires (including BAS, SSS, MFI, and SF-36) at baseline and at 36, 60, and 90 days. Blood samples were collected at the same time points to measure plasma levels of key autophagy markers, BECLIN-1 and pSer258-ATG13, and correlate them with symptom changes.

## What has been found?

The 6 mg/week low-dose rapamycin 💊 regimen was well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events (SAEs) reported. The study found statistically significant reductions in key ME/CFS symptoms, including PEM, fatigue, disturbed sleep, and orthostatic intolerance, as measured by validated questionnaires. These clinical improvements were accompanied by molecular changes indicating restored autophagy: plasma levels of the inhibitory marker pSer258-ATG13 were strongly downregulated , while levels of the autophagy-promoting marker BECLIN-1 were significantly increased. Improvements in symptoms (like PEM and fatigue) correlated significantly with these positive biomarker changes.

## Discussion

The authors identify several key limitations, most notably the "absence of a placebo control group," which makes it impossible to definitively attribute symptom improvements to the drug rather than a placebo effect. The trial also relied solely on self-reported questionnaires for outcomes , had a high dropout rate (often for financial reasons or a lack of perceived benefit) , and did not use a standardized drug formulation, which could affect bioavailability. Despite these limitations, the authors highlight the study's strength as one of the first biomarker-targeted trials for ME/CFS, providing clinical evidence that links mTOR-driven autophagy impairment to the disease's pathophysiology.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that low-dose rapamycin 💊 effectively reduced key ME/CFS symptoms in this cohort, and that these clinical improvements were mechanistically linked to the restoration of autophagy via mTOR inhibition. Future research should focus on dose optimization and developing biomarker tests to identify which patients are most likely to respond. An enhanced, larger trial is planned which will include a placebo-controlled crossover design and objective monitoring with wearable devices.
