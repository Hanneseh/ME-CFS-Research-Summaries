- **What was researched?**
This review paper provides a chronological history of the development of biomarkers used to diagnose Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). It traces the evolution from early functional tests, like visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), to advanced genomic profiling, aiming to establish a clear diagnostic framework that can differentiate CIRS from ME/CFS.
- **Why was it researched?**
CIRS and ME/CFS share debilitating and overlapping symptoms, often leading to misdiagnosis. However, ME/CFS lacks validated biomarkers and a reproducible diagnostic model, whereas CIRS is defined by a consistent pattern of immune dysregulation linked to environmental biotoxin exposure. The author suggests that many patients diagnosed with ME/CFS may actually have unrecognized and treatable CIRS, necessitating a clearer method for differential diagnosis.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that synthesizes peer-reviewed studies, clinical trials, and case reports spanning more than two decades. The author chronologically organizes the integration of CIRS biomarkers, starting with early functional and screening tests and progressing through neuroendocrine, immunologic, volumetric brain imaging, and ultimately transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression: Inflammation Explained (GENIE) platform.
- **What has been found?**
The review demonstrates that CIRS has a structured, reproducible diagnostic model supported by a specific constellation of biomarkers, including low MSH, elevated MMP-9 and TGF-Î²1, and distinct brain volume changes on NeuroQuant MRI. The development of the GENIE transcriptomic test has further refined diagnosis by identifying a core pattern of "molecular hypometabolism" and even suggesting specific environmental triggers like Actinobacteria. The paper highlights that protocol-based treatments, such as cholestyramine (CSM) ðŸ’Š and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) ðŸ’Š, have been shown to normalize these objective markers and resolve symptoms.
- **Discussion:**
The author emphasizes the key distinction between the two illnesses: CIRS has a structured case definition, a reproducible biomarker panel, and measurable responses to targeted therapy. In contrast, ME/CFS is described as a heterogeneous condition with inconsistent case definitions, elusive biomarkers, and primarily symptomatic treatments that do not reverse the underlying pathophysiology. This diagnostic precision in CIRS offers a potential explanation for a subset of patients currently classified under the broader ME/CFS umbrella.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The author concludes that the CIRS framework represents a validated model of an environmentally acquired illness that is responsive to treatment and aligned with precision medicine. Future research should focus on evaluating ME/CFS patients for CIRS to see if they might benefit from its established diagnostic and treatment protocols. The paper suggests the structured, biomarker-guided approach used for CIRS could serve as a model for unraveling other complex, multi-system chronic illnesses.
- **Summary:**
This review provides a comprehensive history of the diagnostic tools developed for Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), an illness triggered by environmental biotoxins from sources like water-damaged buildings. It strongly contrasts the precise, evidence-based diagnostic pathway for CIRS with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding ME/CFS, despite their similar symptom presentations. The paper makes a compelling case that many individuals diagnosed with ME/CFS may instead have treatable CIRS, which can be identified through a specific panel of blood tests, vision screening, brain imaging, and advanced gene expression analysis. By demonstrating that CIRS biomarkers normalize with targeted therapies, this work offers a potential path to an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment for a subset of patients struggling with chronic, unexplained illness.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists reviewed over two decades of research on an illness called CIRS, which is caused by environmental toxins like mold and often mistaken for ME/CFS. They found that CIRS has a reliable set of biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis and to track recovery from treatment. This work provides a clear roadmap for doctors to identify this treatable condition, potentially helping many people who were previously diagnosed with ME/CFS.
