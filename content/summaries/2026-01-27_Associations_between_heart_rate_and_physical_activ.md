## Summary

This study highlights that heart rate issues in Long COVID patients may be most prominent during rest or light movement rather than intense exercise. For patients with ME/CFS symptoms, this validates that their bodies may be under physiological stress (tachycardia) even when they are not actively exercising. These findings reinforce the importance of personalized pacing and autonomic monitoring in rehabilitation.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the relationship between heart rate and physical activity levels in adults with post-COVID-19 condition, while specifically accounting for the presence of ME/CFS symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

Patients with post-COVID-19 condition frequently report tachycardia and exercise intolerance, symptoms that often overlap with ME/CFS, necessitating a clearer understanding of how heart rate responds to daily movement.

## How was it researched?

Sixteen adults with post-COVID-19 condition wore smartwatches and accelerometers for four days to track heart rate and activity intensity. Researchers categorized activity as sedentary, light, or moderate-to-vigorous and assessed the frequency of tachycardia incidents.

## What has been found?

While average heart rate increased with activity, the percentage of time spent in tachycardia (over 100 bpm) was significantly higher during sedentary periods than during moderate-to-vigorous activity. This pattern of sedentary tachycardia remained consistent regardless of whether patients met the criteria for ME/CFS.

## Discussion

The findings are limited by a small, primarily female sample size and the use of commercial wearable devices. However, the results suggest that heart rate dysregulation in these patients is not solely an exercise-induced phenomenon.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Individuals with post-COVID-19 condition experience more frequent tachycardia during minimal activity than during intentional exercise. Management strategies should focus on autonomic stability and heart rate control during daily sedentary or light-intensity tasks.
