## Summary

This research provides a novel AI-driven tool that can identify Long COVID by analyzing metabolic changes in the blood with high accuracy. By successfully separating Long COVID from other similar conditions like ME/CFS and Lyme disease, it offers a path toward faster and more reliable diagnosis. Furthermore, the discovery of a strong molecular link between Long COVID and fibromyalgia provides a new perspective on how these conditions might be related and treated.

## What was researched?

The study focused on developing a machine learning-based diagnostic system for Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) using plasma metabolomics.

## Why was it researched?

PASC is a complex condition with heterogeneous symptoms that currently lacks a formal diagnostic test, making it difficult to differentiate from other chronic illnesses like ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

Researchers trained a multi-layer perceptron model using molecular descriptors of dysregulated metabolites to distinguish PASC from healthy controls and five PASC-similar diseases.

## What has been found?

The model achieved high predictive accuracy and successfully differentiated PASC from ME/CFS, Lyme disease, POTS, and IBS, but found a significant molecular overlap with fibromyalgia.

## Discussion

The study's use of molecular descriptors provides a flexible diagnostic framework that avoids the limitations of fixed biomarker lists. However, the indistinguishable nature of PASC and fibromyalgia in this model suggests shared underlying pathological mechanisms.

## Conclusion & Future Work

This automated approach could reduce the need for lengthy diagnosis-by-exclusion processes and facilitate earlier clinical intervention for patients. Future research should investigate the specific pathways shared between PASC and fibromyalgia.
