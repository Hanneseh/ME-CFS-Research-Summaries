## Summary

This study provides statistical validation for the observation that ME/CFS symptoms are not random but group into specific clusters related to body systems. By bridging patient-reported experiences with biological theories, it supports the classification of ME/CFS as a neuro-immunological multisystem disease. These findings offer a framework for clinicians to move toward more personalized, pathophysiology-guided diagnostic and treatment strategies.

## What was researched?

The study aimed to empirically test and validate hypothesis-driven symptom clusters in ME/CFS to see if they align with known pathophysiological systems like the brain, gut, and immune system.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a highly heterogeneous condition, and understanding how symptoms group together can help clarify the underlying disease mechanisms and improve clinical subgrouping.

## How was it researched?

Researchers analyzed symptom data from 748 adult ME/CFS patients from the APAV-ME/CFS study using Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling. Symptoms were mapped to predefined groups representing neurological, gastrointestinal, immunological, and vegetative (autonomic) systems.

## What has been found?

The analysis successfully identified four coherent symptom clusters: Brain (cognitive/sensory), Gut (gastrointestinal), Immune (immunological), and Vegetative (autonomic). Brain-related symptoms like brain fog and sensory hypersensitivity formed the most coherent factor, while gastrointestinal and immunological symptoms were found to be distinct but related components.

## Discussion

The results demonstrate that the wide variety of ME/CFS symptoms can be systematically attributed to specific functional body systems. A major strength is the large patient cohort and the use of robust statistical modeling to confirm these clinical subgroups.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study reinforces the view of ME/CFS as a complex neuro-immunological disease and suggests that symptom-based subgrouping can inform the development of individualized therapeutic approaches.
