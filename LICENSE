    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later reprisal freely build upon, enhance and reuse the Work for any
purposes whatsoever and in any way whatsoever without restriction under
copyright or related law.

These owners may elect to apply CC0 to their Work and publicly distribute
the Work under its terms.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting against the circumvention of technical measures and
     all other rights resulting from the laws of any jurisdiction that
     protect the non-literal aspects of a Work, such as those relating to
     the structure, sequence, organization and/or appearance of the Work.

2. Waiver. To the fullest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, unconditionally, and
irrevocably waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or hereafter arising, in the Work (and all derivative works
thereto), throughout the world, in perpetuity, in favor of the public (the
"Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the express purpose of enabling
the fullest possible exploitation of the Work by anyone, anywhere, for any
purpose, without any payment, royalty or other financial compensation, and
without any obligation to attribute Affirmer in any manner whatsoever.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be granted to each affected person a royalty-free,
non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by
Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not
(i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this Deed.
  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
     noninfringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
     or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
     Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,
     so this exclusion may not apply to You.
  c. Affirmer disclaims all liability to You for damages, costs, expenses,
     and other compensation, including without limitation direct,
     indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary
     damages, arising out of Your use of the Work or any derivative works
     thereto, even if Affirmer has been advised of the possibility of such
     damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion
     of liability for certain damages, so this limitation or exclusion may
     not apply to You.

5. Miscellaneous.

  a. This Deed shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the
     laws of the jurisdiction where Affirmer is domiciled, or, if Affirmer
     is a corporation or other legal entity, the jurisdiction where its
     principal place of business is located.
  b. If any provision of this Deed is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
     such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or
     enforceability of any other provision hereof.
  c. This Deed constitutes the entire agreement between Affirmer and You
     with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or
     contemporaneous understandings, whether oral or written, relating to
     such subject matter.
