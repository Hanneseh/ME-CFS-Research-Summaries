- **What was researched?**
This study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for treating the core symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), such as pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
- **Why was it researched?**
Fibromyalgia is an incurable chronic condition for which current treatments often provide only moderate or temporary relief and can cause significant side effects. Accumulating evidence suggests HBOT, a non-invasive therapy, may be an effective treatment, but previous reviews lacked sufficient evidence and a formal meta-analysis to confirm its benefits and safety for FM.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. Researchers searched multiple scientific databases for studies on HBOT for FM published up to October 2022. They identified and analyzed nine studies (three randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized controlled trials) involving a total of 288 patients. A meta-analysis was performed on the data for pain relief from the three randomized trials, while other outcomes were analyzed descriptively.
- **What has been found?**
The meta-analysis showed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) ðŸ’Š significantly relieved pain in FM patients compared to control interventions. Most of the included studies also reported that HBOT improved other core symptoms, including tender points, fatigue, multidimensional function, overall patient well-being, and sleep disturbance. Adverse events, most commonly mild and reversible barotrauma (ear pressure issues), occurred in 23.8% of patients receiving HBOT, with 6.5% withdrawing due to side effects; no serious adverse events were reported.
- **Discussion:**
The authors identify the primary limitation as the small number of randomized controlled trials included, which could lead to bias or insufficient evidence. They also note that the clinical heterogeneity in HBOT protocols (e.g., treatment duration and pressure levels) across the studies may have influenced the results. The authors speculate that FM patients may have a lower pain threshold and be more sensitive to discomfort, which could explain the higher rate of adverse events compared to rates reported in other diseases.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that HBOT may have a positive effect on improving pain and other core symptoms of FM, with reversible side effects. They suggest that using lower pressure (less than 2.0 atmospheric absolute) may be beneficial for reducing adverse events. The study calls for further high-quality, large-sample randomized controlled trials to better evaluate HBOT's efficacy, safety, and optimal treatment protocol for FM.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive review suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a promising treatment for fibromyalgia, offering significant pain relief and improvements in fatigue, sleep, and overall function. The therapy appears to be generally safe, with the most common side effects being mild, reversible ear pressure issues that might be reduced by using lower-pressure protocols. While the evidence is encouraging, the authors highlight that it is based on a small number of studies. This research reinforces the potential of HBOT as a non-invasive option for FM, warranting larger, more rigorous clinical trials to confirm its benefits and establish standardized treatment guidelines.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed nine studies and found that high-pressure oxygen therapy can significantly reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia. The therapy also appeared to help with other symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep. While some patients experienced mild, temporary side effects like ear pressure, the treatment was considered safe overall.
