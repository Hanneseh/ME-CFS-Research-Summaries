## Summary

This research identifies the hormone FGF-21 as a potential key for unlocking the biological differences between subgroups of ME and FM patients. The study suggests that both abnormally low and abnormally high levels of FGF-21 are linked to specific symptom patterns, but these links change depending on whether a patient has ME, FM, or both. For example, high FGF-21 was associated with better cognition in ME-only patients but worse physical fatigue in those with both ME and FM. This work provides a framework for classifying patients beyond simple diagnostic labels, which could lead to personalized treatments. The authors discuss several potential therapies to either boost low FGF-21 levels with drugs like metformin 💊 or FGF-21 analogues like efruxifermin 💊, or to address hormone resistance in high-FGF-21 states with agents like PPARy agonists 💊 or senolytics 💊.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the levels of a stress-responsive metabolic hormone called Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) in the blood of patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), Fibromyalgia (FM), and both conditions (ME+FM). The researchers aimed to determine if FGF-21 levels could serve as a biomarker to identify distinct patient subgroups based on their specific symptom patterns and cognitive function.

## Why was it researched?

ME and FM lack objective biomarkers, which complicates diagnosis, treatment, and research. Since FGF-21 is linked to metabolic dysfunction and mitochondrial stress—processes thought to be involved in these illnesses—it was considered a promising candidate biomarker. Previous smaller studies yielded inconsistent results, necessitating this larger, more comprehensive investigation to clarify FGF-21's role and its potential for stratifying patients into more precise clinical subtypes.

## How was it researched?

This was a cross-sectional study involving 250 patients (99 with ME, 47 with FM, 104 with ME+FM) and 54 healthy controls. Diagnoses were confirmed using a validated microRNA panel. Researchers measured plasma FGF-21 levels and categorized all participants into low, normal, or high FGF-21 groups. Symptom severity and cognitive function were assessed using validated questionnaires (DSQ, DPEMQ, SF-36, MFI-20) and the BrainCheck cognitive testing platform, with PEM being assessed after a standardized mechanical provocation test.

## What has been found?

Plasma FGF-21 levels were significantly elevated in patients with ME and ME+FM compared to healthy controls, but not in those with FM alone. More importantly, stratifying patients by their FGF-21 levels revealed distinct clinical profiles that varied by diagnosis. Low FGF-21 levels were associated with more severe PEM and immune/autonomic symptoms in ME patients and with poorer mental health in ME+FM patients. Conversely, high FGF-21 levels correlated with better cognitive performance in the ME group, but with worse physical fatigue in the ME+FM group.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the study's main strength is its large, well-characterized cohort and the stratification by FGF-21 levels, which revealed complex, phenotype-specific correlations. High FGF-21 may represent a protective compensatory mechanism in some ME patients, but could indicate systemic overload or hormone resistance in ME+FM patients. A key limitation is the cross-sectional design, which cannot establish causality. The study also noted discrepancies between self-reported and provocation-based PEM assessments, underscoring the need for objective PEM measurement tools.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that circulating FGF-21 is a nuanced and promising biomarker for ME and FM, capable of stratifying patients into subgroups with distinct symptom and cognitive profiles. This finding supports a move towards personalized medicine by identifying patients who might benefit from different therapeutic strategies. The authors call for future longitudinal studies and clinical trials to validate these subgroups and to test whether modulating FGF-21 signaling can improve patient outcomes.
