## Summary

This study provides strong evidence that ME/CFS and Long COVID are biologically very similar, which validates the experiences of many patients who found their symptoms mirrored across the two conditions. The finding of a "shared signature" of low antiviral immune cells and high inflammation suggests that research progress in one field will likely accelerate progress in the other. For patients, this could mean that diagnostic tools or treatments currently being developed for Long COVID may eventually be applicable to ME/CFS as well. While the study is a significant step in mapping the immune landscape of these illnesses, further research is needed to determine the exact cause of these shared immune changes.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to compare the immune systems of patients diagnosed with ME/CFS and those with Long COVID (specifically post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they share common biological markers. Researchers analyzed specific immune cell subsets and various inflammatory signals (cytokines) to see if these two conditions are immunologically distinct or essentially the same.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS and Long COVID share a high degree of clinical overlap, including symptoms like profound fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM), leading many to hypothesize they may share the same underlying disease mechanisms. However, most previous studies have looked at these conditions in isolation. This research was prompted by the need for direct comparative data to understand if the immune dysfunction seen in both groups is truly comparable.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study involving 190 participants, divided into three groups: 65 patients with ME/CFS, 54 patients with Long COVID, and 70 healthy controls. They utilized flow cytometry to measure levels of various immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and analyzed blood samples for levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Statistical analyses were used to compare these markers between the three groups and to correlate them with the patients' psychological and physical fatigue levels.

## What has been found?

The study found that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit nearly identical immune profiles, with no significant differences found between the two patient groups in any of the tested biomarkers. Both conditions showed significantly lower levels of total lymphocytes, CD8+ "killer" T cells, and NK cells compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, both groups demonstrated significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF, and elevated levels of regulatory cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how the reduction in NK cells and CD8+ T cells suggests a weakened immune defense against viruses and tumors in both conditions. They highlight that the chronic inflammatory state, marked by elevated IL-6 and TNF, likely contributes to the persistent fatigue and multisystemic symptoms reported by patients. The authors note that the lack of biological distinction between the two groups supports the idea that ME/CFS and Long COVID may be different names for a similar post-viral inflammatory syndrome.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS and Long COVID are characterized by comparable immune alterations and inflammatory signatures, suggesting a shared immunopathological basis. They recommend that future research should focus on longitudinal studies to track how these immune markers change over time and to explore whether unified therapeutic strategies could benefit both patient populations.
