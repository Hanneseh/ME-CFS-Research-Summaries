## Summary

This study provides critical evidence that sleep disturbance in Long COVID patients is linked to a failure in the body's natural inflammatory resolution process. By identifying reduced levels of specialized pro-resolving mediators, the research suggests that sleep management could be a key therapeutic target to reduce chronic inflammation and improve recovery.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the impact of sleep disturbance on the levels of lipid-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) 💊 in patients with Long COVID.

## Why was it researched?

Sleep disturbance is a hallmark symptom of Long COVID and is known to promote inflammation, so researchers hypothesized it might prevent the body from successfully resolving the inflammatory response.

## How was it researched?

A cohort of 31 Long COVID patients and 8 controls was assessed for sleep quality and blood concentrations of pro-inflammatory markers and SPMs using mass spectrometry.

## What has been found?

Long COVID patients with high sleep disturbance had significantly lower levels of key SPMs, including 17-HDHA and Resolvin D1, compared to those with better sleep. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory marker PGE2 was elevated in Long COVID participants.

## Discussion

The findings suggest that sleep-related deficits in resolution molecules may drive persistent inflammation. Limitations include the small sample size and observational nature, which prevents establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Sleep disturbance appears to impair the physiology of inflammatory resolution in Long COVID. Enhancing sleep quality or pharmacologically supporting SPM pathways could offer a new mechanistic target for symptom mitigation.
