## Summary

This review consolidates evidence that nutrition is a crucial component in managing Long COVID, a condition with significant overlap with ME/CFS, particularly concerning immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The findings suggest that specific dietary changes—such as adopting a Mediterranean diet or using supplements like Vitamin D/K2, omega-3s, and probiotics—can target the chronic inflammation and gut health issues that may drive persistent symptoms. This research reinforces the potential for personalized nutrition to be a supportive tool for improving fatigue, brain fog, and overall well-being in post-viral illness, while highlighting the urgent need for more rigorous studies to create standardized treatment guidelines.

## What was researched?

This paper provides a narrative review of the existing research on the relationship between nutrition, lifestyle, and Long COVID. The authors aimed to synthesize current knowledge on how dietary interventions, specific nutrients, and physical rehabilitation can help manage the persistent symptoms of Long COVID and to highlight the need for effective nutritional care protocols.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID presents a significant global health challenge, with symptoms spanning multiple organ systems and often involving mitochondrial and immune system dysregulation, similar to other post-viral syndromes. As nutritional interventions have gained attention for managing such conditions, this review was conducted to consolidate the evidence on how diet and lifestyle modifications could specifically address the complex pathophysiology of Long COVID.

## How was it researched?

This study was a narrative literature review. The authors gathered and analyzed a wide range of existing research, including observational studies and randomized controlled trials, to summarize the current understanding of Long COVID's impact on the body. They evaluated the evidence for various interventions, such as supplementation with vitamins and minerals, whole-diet approaches like the Mediterranean diet, the use of probiotics, and the role of tailored exercise programs in patient recovery.

## What has been found?

The review found substantial evidence that targeted nutritional strategies can help manage Long COVID symptoms by addressing underlying issues like inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids 💊, Vitamin D 💊, Vitamin K2 💊, and minerals like magnesium 💊 and zinc 💊 showed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Probiotics 💊 and prebiotics were found to help restore gut health, which is linked to systemic inflammation, while lactoferrin 💊 may help manage iron dysregulation. Additionally, whole-food dietary patterns and phytochemicals like curcumin 💊 and quercetin 💊 demonstrated promise in reducing inflammation and supporting recovery.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that a major challenge in treating Long COVID is the wide variety of symptoms among patients, which makes a single, universal nutritional approach impractical. They note that the evidence base for many treatments is still developing, limited by variations in clinical trial design, sample sizes, and follow-up periods. Therefore, individualized and personalized dietary counseling is essential for effective management.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that nutritional interventions offer a valuable integrative approach to manage the malnutrition, chronic inflammation, and metabolic issues seen in Long COVID. They stress that while promising, significant challenges remain in determining the optimal dosage, duration, and combination of supplements for patients. Further high-quality research and clinical trials are necessary to refine treatment protocols and establish clear, evidence-based guidelines for using diet and exercise to support Long COVID recovery.
