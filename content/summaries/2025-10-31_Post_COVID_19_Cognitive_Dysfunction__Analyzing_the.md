## Summary

This study highlights that cognitive impairment affects nearly one-third of COVID-19 survivors just one month after diagnosis, emphasizing that 'brain fog' is a measurable medical reality. By identifying lifestyle factors like junk food consumption and demographic risks, it provides a roadmap for early screening and targeted recovery interventions. The findings underscore the multi-systemic nature of Long COVID, linking cognitive decline with sensory and fatigue-related symptoms.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the frequency and contributing factors of cognitive impairment, chronic fatigue, and neurological symptoms in COVID-19 survivors four weeks after their diagnosis.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers aimed to understand the lingering psychiatric and neurological burden of the pandemic's fourth wave, specifically focusing on how age, lifestyle, and dietary habits influence cognitive recovery.

## How was it researched?

This multi-centric case-control study compared 176 COVID-19 survivors from Algeria, Egypt, and Libya with 92 healthy controls using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and structured interviews.

## What has been found?

Cognitive impairment was identified in 32.3% of survivors, who also showed higher rates of chronic fatigue and sensory loss. Significant risk factors included older age, smoking, and high junk food consumption, while the condition was more prevalent in females and those with higher education levels.

## Discussion

The results align with global observations of Post-COVID Condition but highlight specific regional lifestyle correlations. Limitations include the reliance on self-reported data and a cross-sectional design that prevents establishing definitive cause-and-effect relationships.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Post-COVID cognitive dysfunction is a significant challenge that requires early clinical screening. Future research should focus on whether specific lifestyle modifications or 'brain-healthy' diets can mitigate these long-term neurological effects.
