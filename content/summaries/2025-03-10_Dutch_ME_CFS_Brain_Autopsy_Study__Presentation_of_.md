## Summary

This landmark autopsy study represents the first systematic, high-resolution analysis of brain tissue from a dedicated ME/CFS cohort. By identifying specific neuro-endocrine changes in the hypothalamus, the research provides a potential biological basis for the HPA-axis dysfunction and autonomic symptoms characteristic of the disease. This work shifts the focus from broad neuroinflammation to specific cellular and molecular changes in regulatory brain regions.

## What was researched?

This research involved a comprehensive post-mortem analysis of brain tissue from the first ten donors in the Dutch ME/CFS Brain Bank to identify structural and molecular abnormalities.

## Why was it researched?

The study aimed to investigate the 'brain disease' hypothesis of ME/CFS by looking for physical evidence of neuro-endocrine disruption, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction that cannot be observed via standard clinical imaging.

## How was it researched?

Researchers performed detailed histological and molecular examinations on tissue from ten autopsied ME/CFS patients, focusing on the hypothalamus, microglial activation, and mitochondrial protein expression. The study also utilized advanced single-cell transcriptomics across multiple brain regions to map gene expression changes in specific cell types.

## What has been found?

The analysis revealed significant changes in the hypothalamus, specifically involving neurons producing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin. While widespread chronic neuroinflammation was not observed, the study found evidence of altered microglial states and mitochondrial signatures. Single-cell sequencing identified unique molecular patterns in glia and neurons that distinguish ME/CFS brain tissue from controls.

## Discussion

A major strength of this study is the high-quality, short-post-mortem-interval tissue provided by the specialized Dutch Brain Bank. Limitations include the small initial sample size of ten cases and the inherent complexity of interpreting post-mortem changes in long-term chronic illness.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The findings suggest that ME/CFS involves specific neurobiological alterations in the HPA-axis regulation center rather than generalized brain inflammation. Future work will expand the cohort to validate these findings and explore their relationship with clinical symptom severity.
