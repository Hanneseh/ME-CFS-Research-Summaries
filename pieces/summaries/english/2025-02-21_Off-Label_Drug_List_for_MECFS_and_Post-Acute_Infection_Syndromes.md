- **What was researched?**
The subject is not a research study, but rather the official announcement that in Austria, the costs for a list of specific off-label drugs for the treatment of ME/CFS and post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), such as Post-COVID Syndrome, will be covered by the statutory health insurance funds (Ã–GK, BVAEB, SVS).
- **Why was it researched?**
The aim of this initiative was to provide patients with access to potentially effective drug treatments that were not previously approved for these conditions. Since there are no approved therapies for ME/CFS and PAIS, this regulation is intended to close a gap in symptomatic care and alleviate the burden on those affected.
- **How was it researched?**
This is a health policy measure based on a collaboration between the Reference Center for Post-Viral Syndromes at the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian social insurance providers. The list was created and approved based on current scientific literature and clinical experience with the successful application of these drugs for symptom improvement.
- **What has been found?**
An agreement was reached that allows doctors to prescribe a range of off-label medications for the indication of ME/CFS and PAIS, with the costs covered by the insurance funds. The list includes medications for treating sleep-wake cycle disorders (e.g., Melatonin), mast cell activation syndromes (e.g., H1/H2 blockers like Desloratadine ðŸ’Š, Ketotifen ðŸ’Š), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (e.g., beta-blockers ðŸ’Š, Ivabradine ðŸ’Š, Mestinon ðŸ’Š), as well as endothelial dysfunction and microthrombi (e.g., statins ðŸ’Š, Sulodexide ðŸ’Š).
- **Discussion:**
The authors of the announcement emphasize that the use of these medications is still considered an "individual treatment attempt." This requires comprehensive patient education and consent. They urge caution regarding drug interactions and contraindications and strongly recommend the "start low, go slow" practice (starting with a very low dose and increasing slowly), which is well-established for ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The introduction of this medication list represents significant progress in the care of ME/CFS and PAIS patients in Austria. It creates an official framework for symptomatic treatment and improves access to therapies. Future work will include the systematic observation of treatment outcomes to further optimize care and create a basis for future clinical trials.
- **Summary:**
This new regulation in Austria provides patients with ME/CFS and PAIS, for the first time, with access to a range of health insurance-funded off-label medications. This allows for the targeted treatment of various symptoms such as sleep disorders, mast cell issues, POTS, or circulatory problems. While this is not a cure, it is a crucial step toward improving symptom management and quality of life, and it acknowledges the serious physical nature of these diseases, which requires a cautious and individualized treatment approach.
- **Simple Summary:**
Austrian health insurance funds will now pay for several medications to treat symptoms of ME/CFS and similar post-viral illnesses. This makes it easier for patients to get treatment for problems like sleep disorders, circulatory dysregulation, or mast cell activation. Doctors must work carefully with patients to find the right therapy and adjust the dosage slowly.
