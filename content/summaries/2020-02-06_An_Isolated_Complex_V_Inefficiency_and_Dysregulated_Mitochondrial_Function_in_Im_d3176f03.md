## Summary

This study identifies a specific problem at the very end of the cellular energy production line (Complex V) in ME/CFS patient immune cells. While the cells successfully compensate for this inefficiency at rest by over-activating other parts of the energy pathway, this state of constant compensation may exhaust their ability to ramp up energy production when needed, such as during physical or mental exertion. This finding provides a potential cellular explanation for post-exertional malaise and other symptoms of energy impairment. By pinpointing a specific molecular inefficiency rather than a general mitochondrial failure, this research offers a more focused target for the development of future diagnostic biomarkers and treatments.

## What was researched?

This study investigated mitochondrial function and cellular stress signaling pathways in immortalized lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) from ME/CFS patients.  The primary goal was to clarify the nature of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS, given the inconsistent findings in previous research.

## Why was it researched?

Previous studies on mitochondrial function in ME/CFS have produced conflicting results, with some reporting reduced function and others finding no significant changes.  The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies might be due to the use of *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which are metabolically inactive and die more rapidly in samples from ME/CFS patients.  To address this, they used metabolically active, immortalized lymphoblasts as a more stable model to reexamine energy metabolism in ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This was an *in vitro* laboratory study analyzing immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from 51 ME/CFS patients and 22 healthy controls.  The researchers used Seahorse extracellular flux analysis to measure mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) and glycolysis.  They also employed whole-cell proteomics and biochemical assays to measure the expression of mitochondrial proteins, steady-state ATP levels, mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and the activity of the TORC1 stress-sensing pathway.

## What has been found?

The study identified an isolated inefficiency in Complex V, the final component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for ATP synthesis.  Although this reduced the efficiency of energy production, ME/CFS cells compensated by upregulating the expression and capacity of other respiratory complexes (I, II, and IV) and increasing their use of fatty acids for fuel.  This compensation successfully maintained normal ATP levels at rest, but was associated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chronically hyperactivated TORC1 stress signaling.

## Discussion

The authors propose that their use of metabolically active lymphoblasts provides a clearer picture than studies using quiescent *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which they found have a higher death rate in ME/CFS samples and may have confounded previous results.  They suggest the observed Complex V inefficiency is likely due to a dysregulation of its activity rather than a genetic defect.  The overall pattern of changes, including the compensatory upregulation of other mitochondrial components, is distinct from findings in other neurological diseases, suggesting a specific pathological mechanism in ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS lymphoblasts exhibit a primary inefficiency in Complex V, leading to a cascade of homeostatic compensations that maintain energy levels in a resting state.  However, because these compensatory pathways are already chronically activated, the cells may be unable to respond to acute increases in energy demand, which could be a cellular basis for post-exertional malaise.  The authors suggest future work should investigate the cause of the Complex V dysfunction and examine whether these findings are replicated in other cell types.
