### 2023-06-22 Study to Investigate Improvement in Physical Function in SF-36 With Vericiguat Compared With Placebo in Participants With Post-COVID-19 Syndrome

- **Overview:**
    - **Trial ID:** NCT05697640
    - **Link:** https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05697640
    - **Sponsor / Lead:** CharitÃ© University, Berlin, Germany
    - **Location(s):** Berlin, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 2
    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-06-22
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31
- **Purpose of the Trial:**
This trial aims to see if an approved drug called Vericiguat ðŸ’Š can relieve profound fatigue and other symptoms in people with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), including those who meet the criteria for ME/CFS. The study is based on the theory that impaired blood flow in small blood vessels contributes to PCS symptoms. Vericiguat is believed to improve this blood flow, which may lead to a reduction in symptoms like fatigue and an improvement in physical function.
- **Trial Design & Procedure:**
    - **Duration:** Approximately 18 weeks.
    - **Design:** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants are randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants nor the investigators know who is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo (a substance with no active ingredient).
    - **Groups:** Participants will be split into two groups. One group will receive Vericiguat, and the other group will receive a matching placebo.
    - **Procedure:** The treatment involves taking one oral tablet daily for 10 weeks. The dose will be gradually increased over the first four weeks. After the 10-week treatment period, there will be a 30-day follow-up period.
- **Key Eligibility Criteria:**
    - **Who may be eligible to participate? (Key Inclusion Criteria)**
        - Adults aged 18 to 50 years.
        - Confirmed previous mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection (non-hospitalized).
        - Ongoing symptoms of Post-COVID Syndrome (with or without ME/CFS) for at least 6 months.
        - Must show evidence of endothelial dysfunction (impaired function of the inner lining of small blood vessels).
        - Bell Score between 30 and 60, indicating moderate to severe illness.
    - **Who is likely not eligible? (Key Exclusion Criteria)**
        - Individuals with a history of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome before their COVID-19 infection.
        - Systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg at screening.
        - Currently using PDE-5 inhibitors (like sildenafil, tadalafil) or nitrates.
        - Received a COVID-19 vaccination within 4 weeks before joining the study.
