# ME/CFS Research Summaries

[Deutsche Version](README-de.md)

## Introduction

This repository provides summaries of key research publications on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID. The goal is to offer a transparent, chronological overview of the scientific progress for patients, caregivers, and their families.

Motivated by a close family member with severe ME/CFS, I monitor new research using PubMed and Google alerts. Promising studies are summarized using a custom AI agent and then manually reviewed for relevance before being added to the list below. You can search this page for the ðŸ’Š emoji to find all mentions of medications and substances being researched.

To provide a high-level overview of the field, the latest research roundup (marked with a ðŸŽ¯) synthesizes all the summarized studies into a single, structured analysis. It tracks the evolution of the science across three key areas: our understanding of the disease's biology, the development of diagnostic tools, and the search for effective treatments. This section serves as an executive summary of the current state of ME/CFS research.

I've made this repository, along with the AI prompts, public so you can follow the progress yourself. If you believe an important study is missing or wish to contribute, please open an Issue or a Pull Request.

### ðŸŽ¯ 2025-08-19 - Research Roundup

**I. Evolution of Disease Understanding**
The scientific understanding of ME/CFS is rapidly consolidating around a model of a post-viral, autoimmune disease characterized by profound dysregulation of cellular energy metabolism, the immune system, and neurovascular function. Landmark genetic research provides a firm biological foundation, linking ME/CFS risk to genes involved in the immune response to infection while definitively ruling out a shared genetic basis with depression [2025-08-06](#2025-08-06-initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome). This immune dysfunction has a clear autoimmune component, with multiple lines of evidence pointing to the pathogenic role of autoantibodies. Studies show that patient-derived IgG can directly enter healthy cells and cause mitochondrial fragmentation, providing a mechanistic link between the immune system and the disease's hallmark energy impairment [2025-08-10](#2025-08-10-mecfs-and-pasc-patient-derived-immunoglobulin-complexes-disrupt-mitochondrial-function-and-alter-inflammatory-marker-secretion). This is further supported by findings that Epstein-Barr Virus reactivation may trigger the production of functionally active autoantibodies that target cellular receptors and disrupt key signaling pathways [2025-06-19](#2025-06-19-advancing-research-on-regulatory-autoantibodies-targeting-gpcrs-insights-from-the-5th-international-symposium). At a fundamental cellular level, impaired autophagyâ€”the body's quality control processâ€”has been shown in animal models to trigger a cascade of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation that worsens with exertion, mirroring post-exertional malaise (PEM) [2025-08-06](#2025-08-06-genetic-depletion-of-early-autophagy-protein-atg13-impairs-mitochondrial-energy-metabolism-augments-oxidative-stress-induces-the-polarization-of-macrophages-to-m1-inflammatory-mode-and-compromises-myelin-integrity-in-skeletal-muscle). This aligns with a model where insufficient blood flow to skeletal muscle during exertion causes a toxic ion imbalance, leading to mitochondrial damage and a self-perpetuating cycle that drives the chronic nature of the illness [2024-11-06](#2024-11-06-key-pathophysiological-role-of-skeletal-muscle-disturbance-in-post-covid-and-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-mecfs-accumulated-evidence).

**II. Evolution in Diagnostics**
The search for objective biomarkers is yielding promising results by focusing on measuring the dynamic, pathological processes of the disease rather than static states. One innovative microfluidic approach demonstrates that red blood cells from ME/CFS patients have an impaired ability to speed up in response to low oxygen, a finding that could explain systemic oxygen delivery issues and has been developed into a machine learning model with high diagnostic specificity [2025-08-11](#2025-08-11-microfluidic-assessment-of-po2-regulated-rbc-capillary-velocity-in-mecfs). Another minimally invasive "liquid biopsy" technique analyzes circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in the blood, identifying a distinct signature in patients that points to widespread immune dysregulation, including T-cell exhaustion and chronic inflammation, and can distinguish patients from controls with promising accuracy [2025-08-11](#2025-08-11-circulating-cell-free-rna-signatures-for-the-characterization-and-diagnosis-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome). This aligns with findings of specific CD8 T-cell dysfunction that could also serve as a diagnostic and treatment-tracking biomarker [2023-12-27](#2023-12-27-identification-of-cd8-t-cell-dysfunction-associated-with-symptoms-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-mecfs-and-long-covid-and-treatment-with-a-nebulized-antioxidantanti-pathogen-agent-in-a-retrospective-case-series). Furthermore, research has identified the immune-regulatory protein SMPDL3B as a novel biomarker whose plasma levels correlate with symptom severity [2025-07-07](#2025-07-07-smpdl3b-a-novel-biomarker-and-therapeutic-target-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitis). These emerging diagnostic tools are powerful because they directly measure the functional impairments in the circulatory and immune systems that are central to the disease's pathophysiology.

**III. Evolution in Finding a Cure**
Therapeutic strategies are increasingly targeting the core autoimmune, metabolic, and vascular dysfunctions identified in recent research. The most promising results have come from immunomodulatory treatments, particularly the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab ðŸ’Š, which targets antibody-producing plasma cells and led to marked, sustained improvement in a majority of patients in a clinical pilot study [2025-07-09](#2025-07-09-plasma-cell-targeting-with-the-anti-cd38-antibody-daratumumab-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-a-clinical-pilot-study). Broader immunosuppressants like Methylprednisolone ðŸ’Š and Prednisolone ðŸ’Š are also being formally trialed [2023-10-01](#2023-10-01-methylprednisolone-in-patients-with-cognitive-deficits-in-post-covid-19-syndrome-pcs) [2022-11-11](#22022-11-11-prednisolone-and-vitamin-b1612-in-patients-with-post-covid-syndrome-previtacov). Based on evidence for impaired autophagy, the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin ðŸ’Š has shown it can alleviate fatigue and PEM in a preliminary trial [2025-06-03](#2025-06-03-low-dose-rapamycin-alleviates-clinical-symptoms-of-fatigue-and-pem-in-mecfs-patients-via-improvement-of-autophagy). Other approaches target related pathologies, such as impaired blood flow with Vericiguat ðŸ’Š [2023-06-22](#2023-06-22-study-to-investigate-improvement-in-physical-function-in-sf-36-with-vericiguat-compared-with-placebo-in-participants-with-post-covid-19-syndrome), metabolic dysfunction with Metformin ðŸ’Š [2023-06-08](#2023-06-08-outpatient-treatment-of-covid-19-and-incidence-of-post-covid-19-condition-over-10-months-covid-out-a-multicentre-randomised-quadruple-blind-parallel-group-phase-3-trial), and neuro-inflammation with low-dose naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š [2025-07-08](#2025-07-08-patient-reported-treatment-outcomes-in-mecfs-and-long-covid). Even earlier-stage research is providing new leads, with *in vitro* studies showing that drugs like saxagliptin ðŸ’Š and vildagliptin ðŸ’Š can correct a specific immune protein abnormality [2025-07-07](#2025-07-07-smpdl3b-a-novel-biomarker-and-therapeutic-target-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitis), while salmeterol xinafoate ðŸ’Š and xanomeline ðŸ’Š can improve red blood cell function in a lab setting [2025-08-11](#2025-08-11-microfluidic-assessment-of-po2-regulated-rbc-capillary-velocity-in-mecfs).

### 2025-08-11 Microfluidic assessment of PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity in ME/CFS

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Yaojun Guo, Sitong Zhou, Samuel Ren, Xin Liu, Mohsen Nemat-Gorgani, Mike Gresser, Ronald W. Davis, Jiandi Wan
    - **Institutes:** Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Davis; Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, Medical Center of University of California, Davis; Henry Gunn High School.
    - **Publisher:** blood RCI
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brci.2025.100019)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated how red blood cells (RBCs) from individuals with ME/CFS change their speed in tiny, capillary-like channels in response to varying oxygen levels ($PO_2$). The researchers explored whether these measurements could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS and be used to evaluate the effects of potential therapeutic drugs.
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous research has consistently shown that ME/CFS patients have impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the underlying cause is unclear. Based on prior findings that RBCs actively regulate capillary blood flow in response to local oxygen demand, the researchers hypothesized that RBC function might be compromised in ME/CFS, contributing to these blood flow abnormalities. This study aimed to test that hypothesis by directly measuring RBC behavior under controlled oxygen conditions.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an *ex vivo* laboratory study using microfluidic devices to mimic blood capillaries. The researchers analyzed blood samples from a cohort of 35 ME/CFS patients and 23 healthy controls. They measured the velocity of isolated RBCs as they passed through the micro-channels at four different oxygen tensions ($PO_2$), from normal to hypoxic levels. The resulting data were analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to assess their diagnostic potential. The team also incubated RBCs from ME/CFS patients with two drugs to see if their function could be improved.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that RBCs from ME/CFS patients have an impaired response to low oxygen. While healthy RBCs sped up significantly as oxygen dropped, ME/CFS RBCs showed a much smaller increase in velocity. The "velocity slope," which measures this sensitivity to oxygen changes, was significantly lower in the ME/CFS group and proved to be a robust biomarker. A machine learning model using this slope feature was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (77.8%), sensitivity (76%), and specificity (90%). Additionally, treating ME/CFS RBCs with salmeterol xinafoate ðŸ’Š and xanomeline ðŸ’Š improved their velocity in response to low oxygen in this lab setting.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the impaired RBC response to low oxygen may be caused by known cellular issues in ME/CFS, such as reduced RBC deformability and increased oxidative stress. They highlight that dynamic measurements, like testing the response to a stressor like hypoxia, appear more effective for diagnosis than static measurements. The primary limitation acknowledged in the paper is the relatively small sample size, which necessitates further validation in larger patient cohorts.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that RBCs from ME/CFS patients exhibit significantly impaired capillary velocity in response to reduced oxygen levels, revealing a previously unrecognized role for RBCs in the disease's pathophysiology. This RBC-based microfluidic method presents a novel and potentially effective approach for ME/CFS classification and assessment. The research is ongoing with plans to continue with a larger patient cohort to improve the detection accuracy and ease of use.
- **Summary:**
This research provides a potential physical explanation for the blood flow abnormalities and oxygen delivery problems often reported in ME/CFS. It suggests that the red blood cells themselves are less able to respond to the body's demand for oxygen, which could contribute to symptoms like post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction. The "velocity slope" measurement developed in this study is a promising candidate for a much-needed objective diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS. Furthermore, the *in vitro* success of two existing drugs in correcting this RBC dysfunction offers a new, targeted avenue for the development of future treatments aimed at improving microcirculation, though these findings are preliminary and require much more research.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists found that red blood cells from ME/CFS patients struggle to speed up when oxygen is low, which may help explain blood flow problems. This discovery could be used to develop a new, objective blood test to help diagnose the illness. In the lab, they also showed that two existing drugs helped the cells function better, opening a new direction for future treatment research.

### 2025-08-11 Circulating cell-free RNA signatures for the characterization and diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Anne E. Gardella, Daniel Eweis-LaBolle, Conor J. Loy, Emma D. Belcher, Joan S. Lenz, Carl J. Franconi, Sally Y. Scofield, Andrew Grimson, Maureen R. Hanson, Iwijn De Vlaminck
    - **Institutes:** Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University; Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University.
    - **Publisher:** PNAS
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2507345122)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are small pieces of genetic material released by cells into the bloodstream, could be used as a minimally invasive tool to diagnose ME/CFS and to better understand its underlying biology. The researchers aimed to identify cfRNA patterns specific to ME/CFS and use them to build a diagnostic model.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS lacks clinically validated biomarkers for an objective diagnosis, forcing reliance on subjective symptom evaluation. Previous research has pointed towards immune system dysregulation in the disease, but the biological mechanisms are poorly understood. The researchers explored cfRNA as a promising "liquid biopsy" tool because it can reflect dynamic changes in gene expression and cellular processes throughout the body, and has been successful in diagnosing other complex inflammatory diseases.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a case-control study that analyzed plasma samples from 93 ME/CFS patients and 75 healthy, sedentary controls. The researchers performed RNA sequencing on the cfRNA isolated from the plasma. They then used computational and machine learning methods to identify cfRNA transcripts that were different between the two groups and trained a diagnostic model to distinguish patients from controls. Additionally, they used a bioinformatic deconvolution technique to estimate the cellular origins of the cfRNA signals.
- **What has been found?**
The study identified 743 unique cfRNA features that differed significantly between ME/CFS cases and controls. A machine learning model (GLMNET Lasso) using a signature of 21 cfRNA genes was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with 77% accuracy and a test-set AUC of 0.81. Analysis of the cfRNA's cellular origins revealed significant differences in immune cell contributions, with ME/CFS patients showing elevated cfRNA from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and T cells, but decreased cfRNA from platelets. Pathway analysis further implicated immune dysfunction, highlighting signatures of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammatory signaling in patients.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the diagnostic model's performance varied among individuals, and this variability was correlated with the amount of platelet-derived cfRNA, suggesting a true biological difference in platelet function in ME/CFS. A key limitation of the study is that it only analyzed samples taken at baseline, without provoking symptoms through an exercise challenge. The authors state that future work is needed to validate the findings in larger patient cohorts to account for disease heterogeneity and improve the model's robustness.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that cfRNA analysis is a valuable, minimally invasive tool for investigating the biology of ME/CFS, providing strong evidence for widespread immune dysregulation in the disease. They suggest that future studies should investigate cfRNA dynamics during post-exertional malaise (PEM) to gain further insight. Expanding the cohort size will be crucial for improving the generalizability and accuracy of cfRNA-based biomarkers for ME/CFS diagnosis and characterization.
- **Summary:**
This study introduces a novel blood analysis technique, called RNA liquid biopsy, that identifies distinct patterns of genetic material (cfRNA) in the blood of ME/CFS patients. The findings strongly support the theory of immune system dysregulation, revealing signals of T cell exhaustion, chronic inflammation, and altered activity in monocytes and dendritic cells. By applying machine learning to these cfRNA patterns, the researchers developed a promising, though not yet perfect, model that could distinguish patients from controls with 77% accuracy. This work represents a significant step towards a much-needed objective, blood-based diagnostic test and provides new molecular evidence reinforcing that ME/CFS is a biological illness rooted in the immune system.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists analyzed fragments of genetic material called RNA in the blood and found specific patterns in ME/CFS patients that point to widespread immune system problems. They used these patterns to train a computer model that can identify ME/CFS from a blood sample with promising accuracy, moving us closer to a potential diagnostic test. This research provides new evidence for the biological basis of the illness, particularly involving immune cell dysfunction.

    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.06.25332978)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether immunoglobulins (specifically IgG antibodies) isolated from the blood of ME/CFS and PASC (Long COVID) patients could directly cause mitochondrial dysfunction in healthy human cells. The researchers examined the effects of these patient-derived IgGs on mitochondrial structure, cellular energy production, and the secretion of inflammatory markers, and also analyzed the composition of proteins bound to the IgGs.
- **Why was it researched?**
Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune system abnormalities are known features of ME/CFS, but the direct cause linking them is not fully understood. Previous research suggested an autoimmune component, as transferring IgG from patients to mice could induce symptoms. This study aimed to test the hypothesis *in vitro* (in a lab dish) that IgG from patients is a direct driver of the mitochondrial and metabolic problems seen in the disease.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an *in vitro* laboratory study using purified IgG antibodies from the blood serum of ME/CFS patients (n=40), PASC patients (n=16), multiple sclerosis patients (n=11), and healthy controls (n=39). The researchers exposed healthy human endothelial cells (HUVECs) to these IgGs and used microscopy to observe changes in mitochondrial structure. They measured cellular energy metabolism using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer and also exposed healthy immune cells (PBMCs) to the IgGs to measure inflammatory cytokine release. Finally, they used mass spectrometry to identify the proteins that were bound to the patient IgGs, a technique called immune complex proteomics.
- **What has been found?**
IgG from a subgroup of ME/CFS and PASC patients caused significant fragmentation of mitochondria in healthy endothelial cells, an effect that was more pronounced with IgG from female patients. While intact IgG was required for fragmentation, its separated 'Fab' fragment alone could alter cellular energy production by increasing maximal respiration, indicating cellular stress. In contrast, the 'Fc' fragment induced a hypometabolic state. Proteomic analysis revealed that ME/CFS immune complexes were enriched with proteins related to extracellular matrix organization, whereas PASC immune complexes were linked to hemostasis (blood clotting regulation).
- **Discussion:**
The authors note the complexity of the findings, where different parts of the IgG molecule (Fab vs. Fc) have distinct effects on cellular energy, and the intact molecule is needed to cause mitochondrial fragmentation. They discuss that the entry of IgG into endothelial cells is a key step, likely mediated by Fc receptors and other non-specific pathways, which could be a pathogenic mechanism in ME/CFS. The distinct protein signatures found in the immune complexes of ME/CFS versus PASC suggest that while the conditions may share symptoms, they may be driven by different underlying biological processes.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The study concludes that IgG from ME/CFS and PASC patients can directly cause mitochondrial fragmentation and metabolic dysregulation in healthy cells, providing a potential pathogenic mechanism for these diseases. The differing protein compositions of immune complexes in ME/CFS and PASC may serve as disease-specific biomarkers. The authors suggest these findings support targeting antibody-mediated pathology as a potential therapeutic strategy for post-infectious illnesses.
- **Summary:**
This study provides direct laboratory evidence that antibodies (IgG) from ME/CFS patients can damage the mitochondriaâ€”the energy factoriesâ€”of healthy cells. This reinforces the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease and offers a potential biological explanation for the profound energy impairment experienced by patients. The research also uncovered key differences between ME/CFS and Long COVID (PASC) at a molecular level; ME/CFS appears linked to issues with the structural support around cells (extracellular matrix), while PASC is more associated with blood clotting pathways. These findings could pave the way for developing more specific diagnostic tests and treatments aimed at correcting these antibody-driven problems.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists showed in the lab that antibodies from ME/CFS patients can damage the energy-producing parts of healthy cells. This research helps explain why energy production is a problem in ME/CFS and points to it being an autoimmune disease. The study also found distinct molecular differences between ME/CFS and Long COVID, which may lead to better tests and treatments in the future.

    - **Publisher:** Preprint
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.06.25333109)
- **What was researched?**
This study aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). By conducting a large genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers compared the DNA of thousands of ME/CFS patients with a large population of healthy controls to find genetic risk factors that could point to the underlying biological mechanisms of the disease.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a common, disabling illness with no known cause, diagnostic test, or effective treatments. Previous genetic studies have been too small to produce robust and replicable findings. Identifying genetic risk factors is a high research priority for patients and is considered a critical step toward developing diagnostics and effective therapies.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) co-produced by scientists and people with ME/CFS. The study recruited participants from the UK, collecting DNA from saliva samples. The final analysis compared the DNA of 15,579 ME/CFS cases of European ancestry against 259,909 healthy controls from the UK Biobank, using stringent case criteria that required a professional diagnosis and the presence of post-exertional malaise.
- **What has been found?**
The study discovered eight distinct genetic loci (regions in the genome) that are significantly associated with ME/CFS. Three of these loci are located near genes involved in the immune response to infection (BTN2A2, OLFM4, and RABGAP1L). One locus, near the gene CA10, shares a common genetic signal with multisite chronic pain. Importantly, the study found no evidence that these genetic risk factors for ME/CFS are shared with depression or anxiety.
- **Discussion:**
The authors attribute the study's success to its high statistical power, achieved through its large size, and its use of stringent case-definition criteria requiring post-exertional malaise. They note that the findings were not replicated in other large biobank analyses, which they suggest could be due to differences in how cases were defined in those cohorts (i.e., not strictly requiring ME/CFS's hallmark symptom). The study was limited to common genetic variants in people of European ancestry, and the authors state the need for further research in more diverse populations and for rarer genetic variants.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that this study provides the first robust evidence that common genetic variation contributes to the risk of developing ME/CFS, indicating that both immunological and neurological processes are involved in its pathology. These findings provide a firm biological foundation for ME/CFS research, which should help reduce stigma and accelerate the search for treatments. Future work will include analyzing DNA from all genetic ancestries, fine-mapping the identified genetic regions, and sequencing whole genomes to search for rare variants.
- **Summary:**
This landmark study, the largest of its kind for ME/CFS, provides the first strong scientific evidence that the illness has a clear biological basis rooted in genetics. The findings link ME/CFS risk to specific genes involved in the immune system's response to infection and genes active in the brain, aligning with the common patient experience of post-viral onset and neurological symptoms like pain and brain fog. By identifying a genetic link to chronic pain but not to depression, this research offers crucial biological evidence that distinguishes ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions. This provides a vital foundation for future research to develop objective diagnostic markers and targeted treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
The largest ever genetic study of ME/CFS found eight specific differences in the DNA of patients compared to healthy people. These results strongly suggest the illness is a real biological disease involving both the immune system and the brain. This is a major step forward, providing a solid basis for future research into what causes the illness and how to diagnose and treat it.

### 2025-08-06 Genetic depletion of early autophagy protein ATG13 impairs mitochondrial energy metabolism, augments oxidative stress, induces the polarization of macrophages to M1 inflammatory mode, and compromises myelin integrity in skeletal muscle

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Mubaraq A. Toriola, Emma Timlin, Sarojini Bulbule, Amy Reyes, Omolola Mary Adedeji, C. Gunnar Gottschalk, Animesh Barua, Leggy A. Arnold, Avik Roy
    - **Institutes:** University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; Simmaron Research INC.
    - **Publisher:** Research Square
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7189456/v1)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the molecular consequences of genetically reducing ATG13, a key protein involved in autophagy (the cell's quality control and recycling system). Using a mouse model, researchers explored how this depletion affects mitochondrial energy metabolism, inflammation in immune cells called macrophages, and the health of nerves within skeletal muscle, particularly in the context of post-exertional malaise (PEM).
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous research showed that disrupting the *atg13* gene in mice led to muscle weakness and nerve damage, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Given that ME/CFS is characterized by PEM, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune abnormalities, the researchers hypothesized that studying the effects of ATG13 depletion could provide a relevant animal model to better understand the molecular basis of the disease.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a preclinical study using a genetically engineered mouse model with a partial deletion of the *atg13* gene ($Tg^{+/-ATG13}$). Researchers compared these mice to normal mice by isolating macrophages from their spleens and analyzing them with multiple lab techniques. They used seahorse assays to measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis, flow cytometry to determine the polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) types, and immunofluorescence to visualize proteins in tissue. Muscle function and fatigue were assessed using open-field behavioral tests and EMG recordings before and after a treadmill exercise challenge.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that reducing ATG13 impaired autophagy, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages, characterized by reduced ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). This metabolic defect caused the macrophages to shift to a pro-inflammatory M1 state. These inflammatory M1 macrophages were found to infiltrate the blood vessels in skeletal muscle, which was associated with damage to the myelin sheath of muscle-serving nerves. Critically, these energy metabolism deficits and the resulting muscle weakness were significantly exacerbated following a treadmill exercise challenge, mirroring the PEM experienced by patients.
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose a novel mechanism where impaired autophagy, caused by ATG13 depletion, triggers a cascade of pathological events relevant to ME/CFS. They suggest that the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress lead to reduced activity of the deacetylase enzyme SIRT1, which in turn promotes a pro-inflammatory state via activation of NF-ÎºB. This model connects the dots between a fundamental cellular process (autophagy), immune cell dysfunction (M1 polarization), and key symptoms like muscle fatigue and PEM.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that the genetic depletion of ATG13 creates a robust model for inflammation-driven muscle fatigue, linking impaired autophagy to mitochondrial deficits, M1 macrophage polarization, and nerve demyelination. Their future work will involve studying M1/M2 polarization in immune cells derived from ME/CFS patients participating in a clinical trial of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ðŸ’Š, aiming to translate these findings from the mouse model to human patients.
- **Summary:**
This research provides a potential biological mechanism that connects impaired cellular "housekeeping" (autophagy) to the mitochondrial dysfunction, immune activation, and post-exertional malaise seen in ME/CFS. By using a mouse model, the study demonstrates how a single genetic defect can cause immune cells to become inflammatory, leading them to infiltrate muscles, damage local nerves, and cause profound weakness that worsens after exertion. This work strengthens the evidence for the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial health in ME/CFS and suggests that targeting these pathways could be a future therapeutic strategy.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists studied mice with a genetic defect in a cellular 'housekeeping' process, causing issues similar to those in ME/CFS. This defect made their immune cells inflammatory, leading to nerve damage in the muscles and severe fatigue. The mice's symptoms, especially fatigue and weakness, got much worse after exercise, providing a model to understand post-exertional malaise.

### 2025-07-25 AI-driven multi-omics modeling of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ruoyun Xiong, Elizabeth Aiken, Ryan Caldwell, Suzanne D. Vernon, Lina Kozhaya, Courtney Gunter, Lucinda Bateman, Derya Unutmaz, Julia Oh
    - **Institutes:** Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; The University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA; The Jackson Laboratory, Farmington, CT, USA.
    - **Publisher:** nature medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03788-3)
- **What was researched?**
This study developed and applied a deep neural network, named BioMapAI, to a large longitudinal, multi-omics dataset from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. The objective was to integrate diverse biological dataâ€”including gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, and immune profilingâ€”to predict clinical symptom severity, identify specific biomarkers, and create a comprehensive map of the biological interactions underlying the disease.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a complex illness with highly variable symptoms, which makes diagnosis and treatment challenging. Previous studies often focused on identifying one or two key disease indicators, an approach that fails to capture the multifaceted nature of the condition. This research was motivated by the need for methods that can link a wide range of biological data types to the complex matrix of patient-specific symptoms, enabling a more personalized understanding of the disease.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a 4-year longitudinal study that collected data from a cohort of 153 ME/CFS patients and 96 healthy controls. The researchers gathered multiple data types: gut microbiome sequencing, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiling, standard blood lab results, and detailed clinical questionnaires. They used this extensive dataset to train BioMapAI, an explainable AI model, to map the biological profiles to 12 core clinical symptom scores. The model's ability to classify ME/CFS was validated using both held-out data from the cohort and four independent, external patient datasets.
- **What has been found?**
The BioMapAI model successfully classified ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (91% AUC). The study identified both disease-specific biomarkers (consistent across most symptoms) and, more uniquely, symptom-specific biomarkers. Key findings include altered associations in ME/CFS between gut microbial metabolism (e.g., of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, BCAAs, and tryptophan) and a heightened inflammatory response from specific T cell subsets (MAIT and $\gamma\delta$T cells). These disruptions in the microbe-immune network were strongly correlated with the severity of symptoms like fatigue, pain, gastrointestinal issues, and sleep disturbances.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations, including that the model was not tested for its ability to differentiate ME/CFS from other conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as fibromyalgia. The study cohort was from a single geographic location and predominantly white, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the 4-year study period may not be sufficient to capture the full, often decades-long, nonlinear progression of ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that their AI-driven, multi-omics approach provides unprecedented systems-level insights into ME/CFS, refining existing hypotheses and generating new ones about the disrupted connections between the microbiome, metabolome, and immune system. While the findings are not yet ready for direct therapeutic application, they offer numerous avenues for future mechanistic studies. The researchers suggest future work should include longer follow-up periods and incorporate other data types, like host RNA sequencing, to further unravel the disease's complexity.
- **Summary:**
This study introduces a powerful AI tool that integrates vast amounts of biological data from the gut, blood, and immune system to create a more comprehensive and personalized picture of ME/CFS. By connecting specific biological abnormalities to individual symptoms, it moves beyond a simple "sick vs. healthy" comparison and begins to explain the disease's profound variability. The findings reinforce that ME/CFS involves a significant breakdown in the communication between the gut microbiome and the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation that correlates with symptom severity. This approach provides a new framework for discovering more precise biomarkers and generating targeted hypotheses for future treatment research.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers used an advanced AI to analyze complex biological data from patients' gut, blood, and immune systems. The AI found specific biological patterns linked to different ME/CFS symptoms, helping to explain why the illness varies so much between individuals. These findings point to a breakdown in communication between the gut and the immune system, which could be a key driver of the disease and offers new directions for research.

### 2025-07-15 Two neurocognitive domains identified for patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ariadna Sandoval, Mingqi Li, Leonard A. Jason
    - **Institutes:** Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States.
    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Neurology
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2025.1612548)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the structure of self-reported neurocognitive symptoms in large groups of patients with ME/CFS and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Researchers aimed to determine if symptoms like sensory hypersensitivity, which are often overlooked, group together with more classic "brain fog" symptoms like memory and concentration problems, or if they form a separate category.
- **Why was it researched?**
While memory and concentration problems are well-recognized neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS and PASC, sensory issues like hypersensitivity to light and noise have been less formally studied as part of this symptom cluster. Some diagnostic criteria, like the Canadian Consensus Criteria, include these sensory disturbances. This research was prompted by the need to statistically evaluate whether these sensory symptoms constitute a distinct domain of neurocognitive impairment in these post-viral illnesses.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a patient data analysis study using self-report surveys. The researchers aggregated data from 2,313 patients with ME/CFS and 299 patients with PASC who had completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ-1). They then used a statistical method called exploratory factor analysis on 13 neurocognitive symptom items from the questionnaire to identify underlying patterns and group related symptoms into distinct "factors" for each illness group.
- **What has been found?**
The analysis revealed a similar two-factor structure for both the ME/CFS and PASC groups. The first factor consisted of classic cognitive symptoms such as problems with memory, slowness of thought, and difficulty paying attention. The second, distinct factor consisted of sensory and perceptual disturbances, including sensitivity to light, noise, and smells. The study also found that patients who reported more severe functional impairment scored significantly worse on both of these neurocognitive factors.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note several limitations, including the reliance on self-reported diagnoses and symptoms rather than clinical confirmation, and the unequal sample sizes between the ME/CFS and PASC groups. They suggest the two identified factors may correspond to dysfunction in different brain networks, with the memory/concentration factor relating to the Central Executive Network and the sensory factor relating to overactivation of the Salience Network. The influence of comorbid conditions on these networks was acknowledged as a complex area for future study.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that the neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS and PASC can be classified into two distinct domains: one related to memory and concentration, and another related to sensory overload. These findings suggest that research and clinical assessment should expand beyond traditional cognitive complaints to include sensory disturbances as a core feature. Future research should aim to connect these self-reported symptom domains with objective biological measures and further explore the underlying brain network abnormalities.
- **Summary:**
This study provides statistical evidence that the "brain fog" experienced by patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID is not a single entity, but is composed of at least two distinct types of problems: traditional cognitive difficulties (memory, focus) and sensory overload (hypersensitivity to light, noise, smells). By formally identifying sensory issues as a separate but core component of neurocognitive impairment, this research validates a key aspect of the patient experience. This framework could improve diagnostic criteria, allow for more precise symptom tracking in clinical trials, and guide researchers to investigate specific brain networks, like the Salience Network, as potential targets for future treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed patient surveys and confirmed that "brain fog" has two main parts: memory and concentration problems, and a separate issue of sensory overload like sensitivity to light and sound. This finding helps validate that sensory problems are a core part of the illness, not just a minor symptom. This better understanding can help guide future research into what goes wrong in the brain and how to treat it.

### 2025-07-09 Plasma cell targeting with the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome-a clinical pilot study

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ã˜ystein Fluge, Ingrid Gurvin Rekeland, Kari SÃ¸rland, Kine Alme, Kristin Risa, Ove Bruland, Karl Johan Tronstad, Olav Mella
    - **Institutes:** The Cancer Clinic, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway; Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway; Department of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.
    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2025.1607353)
- **What was researched?**
This clinical pilot study investigated the safety and feasibility of using the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab ðŸ’Š to target and deplete plasma cells in patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. The researchers also assessed whether this treatment could lead to clinical improvement over a 12 to 24-month follow-up period.
- **Why was it researched?**
The study was based on the hypothesis that ME/CFS is an autoimmune condition driven by functional autoantibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells. Previous trials using the B-cell depleting drug rituximab failed to show a difference from placebo, which the researchers speculate is because rituximab does not affect these long-lived plasma cells. This study aimed to test if directly targeting these antibody-producing cells with daratumumab could be a more effective strategy.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a prospective, open-label pilot trial involving ten female patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. After a 12-week observation period, all patients received injections of daratumumab; six patients received four injections and four patients received a total of seven injections. Clinical outcomes were measured using self-reported questionnaires (SF-36 Physical Function and DSQ-SF), physical activity trackers (Fitbit), and laboratory tests, including immunoglobulin (IgG) and Natural Killer (NK) cell counts.
- **What has been found?**
The treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Six out of the ten patients experienced marked and sustained clinical improvement, with five of them reaching a physical function score close to or within the normal population range by the end of the follow-up. For the six responders, the average physical function score (SF-36 PF) increased from 32.2 to 78.3. The study also found a significant correlation between a higher baseline NK-cell count and a positive clinical response.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the main limitations of the study are the small number of participants (10), the inclusion of only female patients, and the open-label design, which lacks a placebo control group. They suggest the observed association between higher baseline NK-cell counts and clinical improvement may be biologically significant, as NK cells are involved in the drug's mechanism of depleting plasma cells. The dichotomous response patternâ€”either pronounced improvement or no change at allâ€”was a notable observation.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that targeting plasma cells with daratumumab was feasible, safe, and associated with major and durable symptom improvement in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that functional autoantibodies from long-lived plasma cells play a key role in the disease. A larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was launched in June 2025 to confirm these promising results.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong preliminary evidence for the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease driven by autoantibodies. By using a drug that targets the specific immune cells responsible for long-term antibody production, researchers observed significant, life-altering improvements in a majority of the trial participants. The finding that a higher baseline count of Natural Killer (NK) cells was associated with a better outcome could potentially lead to a biomarker to predict who would benefit from this type of treatment. While these results from a small, open-label trial are very encouraging, they must be confirmed in the larger, placebo-controlled trial that is now underway before any definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy can be made.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a drug that targets specific immune cells suspected of causing ME/CFS, based on the theory that it is an autoimmune illness. In this small, initial study of ten women, six experienced significant and lasting improvements in their health. These hopeful results are a promising first step, and a larger, more rigorous study has now begun to verify if the treatment is truly effective.

### 2025-07-08 Patient-reported treatment outcomes in ME/CFS and long COVID

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Martha Eckey, Peng Li, Braxton Morrison, Jonas Bergquist, Ronald W. Davis, Wenzhong Xiao
    - **Institutes:** Computational Research Center for Complex Chronic Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School; The Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Collaborative Research Centre, Department of Chemistry BMC, Uppsala University; Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Collaborative Research Center, Stanford University School of Medicine.
    - **Publisher:** PNAS
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426874122)
- **What was researched?**
This study analyzed patient-reported outcomes from a large survey of 3,925 individuals to assess the perceived effectiveness of more than 150 different treatments for ME/CFS and long COVID. The research also explored the relationships between patient demographics, symptom profiles, comorbidities, and their responses to these interventions.
- **Why was it researched?**
With no FDA-approved treatments for either ME/CFS or long COVID, patients rely on off-label and palliative therapies. This study was conducted to gather real-world evidence from patient experiences, aiming to identify potentially effective management strategies, highlight symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between the two conditions, and help generate new avenues for future clinical trials.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a patient-reported outcomes study based on data from the online "TREATME" survey. The researchers collected responses from 3,925 patients (2,125 with ME/CFS and 1,800 with long COVID) regarding their symptoms, comorbidities, and perceived effectiveness of various treatments. A "Net Assessment Score" (NAS) was calculated to quantify the benefit of each intervention, and clustering analysis was used to identify patient subgroups based on their unique symptom profiles.
- **What has been found?**
The study revealed a strong correlation ($R^{2}=0.68$) in treatment responses between ME/CFS and long COVID patients, who also shared similar core symptoms like PEM and fatigue. The interventions with the greatest perceived benefits included pacing, fluids/electrolytes ðŸ’Š, compression stockings, low-dose naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š, antihistamines ðŸ’Š, nattokinase/lumbrokinase ðŸ’Š, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IgG) ðŸ’Š. Four distinct patient subgroups with unique symptom profiles (e.g., "POTS-Dominant") were identified, showing varied responses to specific treatments, such as ADHD stimulants ðŸ’Š being most effective in the "Cognitive and Sleep Dysfunction" cluster. Graded exercise therapy (GET) was overwhelmingly reported as harmful.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the study's findings support the use of large-scale patient surveys for gathering real-world evidence. They acknowledge several limitations, including the self-reported nature of the data, potential for sampling and recall bias, the absence of a true placebo control group, and the difficulty of attributing effects when patients use multiple treatments simultaneously. The reliability for some treatments is also limited by a small number of responses.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The researchers conclude that patient-reported data from large surveys provide a valuable foundation of real-world evidence for therapies and can help inform the design of future clinical trials for ME/CFS and long COVID. They suggest future studies could be enhanced by integrating data from health-tracking apps and electronic health records, and by using more targeted surveys to confirm these preliminary findings.
- **Summary:**
This large-scale survey reinforces the significant symptomatic and therapeutic overlap between ME/CFS and long COVID, suggesting they may share underlying disease mechanisms. By analyzing patient experiences, the research identified several widely-used treatmentsâ€”such as pacing, electrolytes, and LDNâ€”that are perceived as highly beneficial, while confirming that graded exercise therapy is seen as harmful. The identification of distinct patient subgroups who respond differently to specific medications supports a move towards personalized medicine and provides a data-driven basis for designing more targeted and effective clinical trials for these complex illnesses.
- **Simple Summary:**
A large survey showed that people with ME/CFS and long COVID have similar symptoms and often benefit from the same treatments. Pacing energy, staying hydrated with electrolytes, and specific medications like low-dose naltrexone were reported as most helpful. This information helps doctors understand what is working for patients and gives researchers better ideas for future studies.

### 2025-07-07 SMPDL3B a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in myalgic encephalomyelitis

    - **Publisher:** Journal of Translational Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-06829-0)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the role of a specific immune-regulatory protein, Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B), in ME/CFS. Researchers aimed to determine if levels of this protein could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and if modulating it could represent a new therapeutic strategy.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a debilitating illness with no objective diagnostic tests or targeted treatments, partly due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying biology. Since immune dysfunction is a known hallmark of the disease, the researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of SMPDL3B, a protein involved in regulating innate immune responses, might contribute to the chronic inflammation and impaired antiviral defenses seen in patients.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a case-control study that analyzed blood samples from two separate groups: a Canadian cohort of 249 ME patients and 63 healthy controls, and a Norwegian replication cohort of 141 ME patients. The researchers used ELISA and flow cytometry to measure the levels of SMPDL3B in the plasma (soluble form) and on the surface of immune cells (membrane-bound form). They also performed *in vitro* experiments on immune cells (PBMCs) to see if existing drugs could correct any abnormalities found.
- **What has been found?**
ME/CFS patients had significantly elevated levels of soluble SMPDL3B in their plasma, and these higher levels correlated with greater symptom severity. In contrast, the amount of SMPDL3B attached to the surface of their immune cells (monocytes) was significantly reduced. This appears to be caused by increased activity of an enzyme called PI-PLC, which cleaves SMPDL3B from the cell membrane. In laboratory experiments, two existing drugs, vildagliptin ðŸ’Š and saxagliptin ðŸ’Š, successfully restored the membrane-bound SMPDL3B and reduced the soluble form by inhibiting PI-PLC activity.
- **Discussion:**
The authors suggest that the loss of membrane-bound SMPDL3B, which normally helps to dampen inflammatory signaling (via TLR4), could contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in ME/CFS. This imbalance could also explain previously observed abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The primary limitations noted were the cross-sectional study design, which cannot prove causation, and a significant female predominance in the patient cohorts, which limited robust analysis of sex-specific differences.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that SMPDL3B is a promising biomarker for ME/CFS severity and a potential therapeutic target. The *in vitro* success of vildagliptin and saxagliptin in preserving membrane-bound SMPDL3B suggests a novel treatment strategy for restoring immune balance. The study calls for future clinical trials to evaluate the potential of these drugs to mitigate immune dysfunction and reduce symptoms in ME/CFS patients.
- **Summary:**
This research identifies a specific molecular abnormality in the immune cells of ME/CFS patients that directly correlates with disease severity. It suggests that a key regulatory protein (SMPDL3B) is being improperly cut from the surface of immune cells, leading to increased inflammation. This provides a potential biological explanation for some of the immune dysregulation in the illness and offers a quantifiable biomarker. Most significantly, the study showed in a lab setting that two existing drugs can reverse this process, presenting a clear and targeted new avenue for the development of future treatments that must now be tested in human trials.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists discovered that a protein which helps control inflammation is being cut off from immune cells in people with ME/CFS, and this is linked to more severe symptoms. This finding could lead to a new blood test to help measure the severity of the illness. In the lab, two existing drugs were able to stop the protein from being cut off, offering a new direction for future treatment research.

- **What was researched?**
This paper summarizes the key findings from the 5th International Symposium on Regulatory Autoantibodies Targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (RAB-GPCRs). It reviews the current understanding of how these autoantibodies function as active modulators in various diseases, including Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), and explores their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
- **Why was it researched?**
This research was motivated by the growing evidence that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are not merely passive disease markers but are active contributors to pathophysiology by altering cellular signaling. The symposium aimed to bring together experts from immunology, neurology, and rheumatology to consolidate knowledge and address the complex role these autoantibodies play in post-viral illnesses like ME/CFS/PCS and other autoimmune conditions.
- **How was it researched?**
This article is a comprehensive review and summary report of the scientific presentations and discussions from an international symposium. It synthesizes findings from recent studies and expert consensus across multiple fields. A key area of focus was a recent study by Hoheisel et al., which investigated the role of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in triggering the production of these autoantibodies in ME/CFS and PCS patients.
- **What has been found?**
The symposium reinforced that functionally active autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are significantly involved in ME/CFS and PCS pathophysiology. A major insight discussed was that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation may be a key trigger, as certain EBV proteins mimic human GPCRs, leading to cross-reactive autoantibodies through molecular mimicry. These autoantibodies were found to be elevated in ME/CFS and PCS patients, correlated with symptom severity, and are believed to contribute directly to symptoms like dysautonomia, fatigue, and pain by disrupting adrenergic receptor signaling. The paper also noted that pathological effects of certain GPCR autoantibodies on blood vessel lining could be reversed by losartan ðŸ’Š in a laboratory setting.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight a paradigm shift in understanding anti-GPCR autoantibodies, now viewing them as dynamic, functionally active agents rather than static biomarkers. They note that these autoantibodies can have a dual nature, acting as either regulatory or pathogenic depending on their concentration, specificity, and the biological context. A primary challenge that remains is to distinguish between their normal regulatory functions and their disease-causing roles to develop them into reliable clinical tools.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are central players in the mechanisms of a wide spectrum of diseases, including ME/CFS. They strongly advocate for future research to adopt integrative, systems-level approaches that combine autoantibody profiles with other biological data (multi-omics). Such approaches are considered essential for decoding the full impact of these autoantibodies and developing novel strategies for diagnosis and precision immunomodulation in chronic diseases.
- **Summary:**
This report consolidates strong evidence that functional autoantibodies attacking the body's own cellular receptors (GPCRs) are a key part of the disease process in ME/CFS and post-COVID conditions. It highlights a compelling theory that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation can trigger the production of these harmful autoantibodies through "molecular mimicry," offering a potential explanation for the autoimmune features of the illness. This mechanism provides a direct biological basis for symptoms like autonomic dysfunction and fatigue, as these autoantibodies can disrupt critical signaling pathways. This line of research is crucial as it paves the way for specific diagnostic markers and targeted treatments aimed at removing or blocking these autoantibodies.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists are increasingly certain that in ME/CFS, the immune system mistakenly creates antibodies that attack the body's own cell receptors. New findings suggest that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may trigger this process by tricking the immune system. This understanding helps explain symptoms and is guiding research toward new diagnostic tests and targeted treatments.

### 2025-06-03 Low Dose Rapamycin Alleviates Clinical Symptoms of Fatigue and PEM in ME/CFS Patients via Improvement of Autophagy
- **Metadata:**
  - **Authors:** Brian T. Ruan, Sarojini Bulbule, Amy Reyes, Bela Chheda, Lucinda Bateman, Jennifer Bell, Braydon Yellman, Stephanie Grach, Jon Berner, Daniel L. Peterson, David Kaufman, AVIK ROY, C. Gunnar Gottschalk

  - **Publisher:** Research Square (Preprint).
  - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6596158/v1)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the safety and efficacy of low-dose rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, for treating core symptoms of ME/CFS. The researchers also examined whether clinical improvements correlated with changes in blood-based biomarkers related to autophagy, a cellular self-cleaning process.
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous research from the authors and others suggested that chronic activation of a protein called mTOR and the resulting impairment of autophagy may be a key driver of ME/CFS pathology, particularly post-exertional malaise (PEM). They hypothesized that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin could restore autophagy and therefore alleviate ME/CFS symptoms. This study aimed to test that hypothesis directly in patients for the first time.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a decentralized, uncontrolled, observational clinical study involving ME/CFS patients from six clinical centers in the United States. Of the 86 patients who started the therapy, 40 completed the full 90-day protocol. Participants self-administered low-dose rapamycin ($6\ \text{mg/week}$) and completed validated questionnaires (BAS, SSS, MFI, SF-36) at baseline and at 30, 60, and 90 days to assess changes in symptoms. Plasma samples were collected at the same time points to measure levels of two autophagy biomarkers, BECLIN-1 and phosphorylated ATG13 (pSer258-ATG13).
- **What has been found?**
Low-dose rapamycin ðŸ’Š was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. The study found statistically significant improvements in key ME/CFS symptoms, including fatigue, PEM, disturbed sleep, and orthostatic intolerance, in the cohort that completed the trial. These clinical improvements correlated with molecular evidence of restored autophagy: plasma levels of the inhibitory marker pSer258-ATG13 decreased significantly, while levels of the pro-autophagy marker BECLIN-1 increased. The therapeutic response was notably stronger in patients who had a post-infectious (viral) onset of their ME/CFS.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations, most significantly the absence of a placebo control group, which makes it impossible to definitively attribute the observed improvements to the drug alone. The study also relied on self-reported questionnaires rather than objective performance measures, had a high dropout rate (primarily due to the cost of the drug and lab tests not being covered), and did not control for variability between different generic formulations of rapamycin. However, the study's strengths include its biomarker-driven hypothesis and a within-subject design where each patient served as their own control.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that low-dose rapamycin can effectively and safely reduce fatigue, PEM, and other core symptoms in a subset of ME/CFS patients. The results provide the first clinical evidence supporting the theory that mTOR activation and impaired autophagy play a role in the disease's pathophysiology. The authors strongly recommend future research in the form of a larger, fully funded, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to validate these preliminary findings and suggest developing biomarker tests to identify patients most likely to respond to this therapy.
- **Summary:**
This study provides preliminary but promising evidence for a new ME/CFS treatment target. It suggests that in some patients, an overactive cellular pathway (mTOR) blocks a critical "clean-up" process called autophagy, contributing to symptoms. The use of low-dose rapamycin appeared to correct this issue, leading to significant reductions in fatigue and PEM, especially in patients whose illness began after an infection. The observed changes in blood biomarkers of autophagy support this mechanism. While this was a small, uncontrolled study requiring confirmation in a larger, placebo-controlled trial, it represents a significant step forward by testing a mechanistically-targeted therapy and identifying potential biomarkers to personalize treatment for ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a drug called rapamycin and found it helped reduce fatigue and PEM for many ME/CFS patients in this small, early-stage study. The drug appears to work by fixing a cellular cleaning process that may be broken, particularly in patients who became ill after an infection. Although more research is needed, this provides a hopeful new direction for a targeted treatment.

    - **Publisher:** Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2025.2492774)
- **What was researched?**
This editorial reviews the current evidence for therapies that target autoantibodies (AAbs) as a potential treatment strategy for Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It summarizes the results of clinical trials for various immunomodulatory drugs and procedures.
- **Why was it researched?**
There is mounting evidence suggesting that autoimmunity, specifically the presence of harmful autoantibodies, plays a role in a subset of patients with PCS and ME/CFS. As there are no approved causal therapies for these conditions, exploring treatments that can remove or neutralize these autoantibodies is considered one of the most promising avenues for developing effective interventions.
- **How was it researched?**
This article is an expert opinion and literature review. The authors analyzed and summarized the findings from various clinical trials and observational studies investigating AAb-targeting therapies. The treatments reviewed include B-cell depleting agents like rituximab ðŸ’Š, immunoadsorption ðŸ’Š, intravenous immunoglobulins ðŸ’Š (IVIG), and newer drugs such as daratumumab ðŸ’Š, efgartigimod, and rovunaptabin (BC007).
- **What has been found?**
The review found mixed results across different AAb-targeting therapies. While early-phase trials of rituximab and observational studies of immunoadsorption and IVIG showed promising results in some ME/CFS and PCS patients, subsequent larger or controlled trials have often been disappointing. For instance, a phase III trial of rituximab failed to show significant benefits, and recent phase II trials of efgartigimod and rovunaptabin in PCS also failed to meet their primary endpoints. Preliminary results for daratumumab are encouraging but very early.
- **Discussion:**
The authors argue that a major reason for the inconsistent and often negative trial results is the failure to account for the heterogeneity of these illnesses. Most studies did not select patients based on evidence of autoimmunity, such as the presence of specific AAbs. This lack of patient stratification likely led to the inclusion of patients whose disease is not driven by autoantibodies, thereby diluting any potential treatment effect and contributing to trial failures.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that AAb-targeting therapy remains a promising strategy for a specific subgroup of PCS and ME/CFS patients. To move forward, future clinical trials must be designed with better patient selection criteria. They suggest using biomarkers, such as specific autoantibodies or a positive response to a preliminary treatment like immunoadsorption, to identify patients with a high likelihood of an AAb-mediated disease before enrolling them in trials for B-cell depleting therapies.
- **Summary:**
This review consolidates the idea that for a subset of ME/CFS and Post-COVID patients, the illness may be driven by an autoimmune process involving harmful antibodies. It explains that clinical trials for treatments targeting these antibodies have produced mixed results, likely because they were tested on broad patient groups rather than just those with clear signs of autoimmunity. The key message is that future research must focus on using biomarkers to identify the right patients for these specific therapies, a strategy that could finally lead to effective, personalized treatments for this subgroup of patients.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists reviewed different treatments that target the immune system for people with ME/CFS and Post-COVID Syndrome. The results have been mixed, suggesting these therapies may only help patients whose illness is caused by an autoimmune problem. Future studies need to use tests to find these specific patients before starting treatment, which could make the treatments much more successful.

### 2025-02-21 Off-Label Drug List for ME/CFS and Post-Acute Infection Syndromes

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Reference Center for Post-Viral Syndromes
    - **Institutes:** Medical University of Vienna
    - **Publisher:** Medical University of Vienna
    - **Link:** [For doctors, healthcare professionals & stakeholders](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/referenzzentrum-postvirale-syndrome/fuer-aerztinnen-gesundheitsberufe/)
- **What was researched?**
The subject is not a research study, but rather the official announcement that in Austria, the costs for a list of specific off-label drugs for the treatment of ME/CFS and post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), such as Post-COVID Syndrome, will be covered by the statutory health insurance funds (Ã–GK, BVAEB, SVS).
- **Why was it researched?**
The aim of this initiative was to provide patients with access to potentially effective drug treatments that were not previously approved for these conditions. Since there are no approved therapies for ME/CFS and PAIS, this regulation is intended to close a gap in symptomatic care and alleviate the burden on those affected.
- **How was it researched?**
This is a health policy measure based on a collaboration between the Reference Center for Post-Viral Syndromes at the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian social insurance providers. The list was created and approved based on current scientific literature and clinical experience with the successful application of these drugs for symptom improvement.
- **What has been found?**
An agreement was reached that allows doctors to prescribe a range of off-label medications for the indication of ME/CFS and PAIS, with the costs covered by the insurance funds. The list includes medications for treating sleep-wake cycle disorders (e.g., Melatonin), mast cell activation syndromes (e.g., H1/H2 blockers like Desloratadine ðŸ’Š, Ketotifen ðŸ’Š), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (e.g., beta-blockers ðŸ’Š, Ivabradine ðŸ’Š, Mestinon ðŸ’Š), as well as endothelial dysfunction and microthrombi (e.g., statins ðŸ’Š, Sulodexide ðŸ’Š).
- **Discussion:**
The authors of the announcement emphasize that the use of these medications is still considered an "individual treatment attempt." This requires comprehensive patient education and consent. They urge caution regarding drug interactions and contraindications and strongly recommend the "start low, go slow" practice (starting with a very low dose and increasing slowly), which is well-established for ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The introduction of this medication list represents significant progress in the care of ME/CFS and PAIS patients in Austria. It creates an official framework for symptomatic treatment and improves access to therapies. Future work will include the systematic observation of treatment outcomes to further optimize care and create a basis for future clinical trials.
- **Summary:**
This new regulation in Austria provides patients with ME/CFS and PAIS, for the first time, with access to a range of health insurance-funded off-label medications. This allows for the targeted treatment of various symptoms such as sleep disorders, mast cell issues, POTS, or circulatory problems. While this is not a cure, it is a crucial step toward improving symptom management and quality of life, and it acknowledges the serious physical nature of these diseases, which requires a cautious and individualized treatment approach.
- **Simple Summary:**
Austrian health insurance funds will now pay for several medications to treat symptoms of ME/CFS and similar post-viral illnesses. This makes it easier for patients to get treatment for problems like sleep disorders, circulatory dysregulation, or mast cell activation. Doctors must work carefully with patients to find the right therapy and adjust the dosage slowly.

### 2024-11-06 Key Pathophysiological Role of Skeletal Muscle Disturbance in Post COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): Accumulated Evidence

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Carmen Scheibenbogen, Klaus J. Wirth
    - **Institutes:** Institute of Medical Immunology, CharitÃ© - UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin; Mitodicure GmbH, Kriftel, Germany; Institute for General Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital, Goethe University Frankfurt am Main.
    - **Publisher:** Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.13669)
- **What was researched?**
This review article collects and synthesizes recent scientific evidence to explain the central role of skeletal muscle abnormalities in both Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It proposes a specific biological mechanism to explain how an initial infection can lead to the chronic symptoms of ME/CFS, particularly post-exertional malaise (PEM).
- **Why was it researched?**
The authors previously hypothesized in 2021 that impaired blood flow (hypoperfusion) to muscles in ME/CFS patients could cause an overload of sodium and calcium within muscle cells, leading to mitochondrial damage. Since then, new experimental studies have provided strong evidence supporting this concept, necessitating an updated review to consolidate these findings and build a more complete picture of the disease's pathophysiology.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that synthesizes findings from recent experimental research. The authors analyzed data from multiple types of studies, including muscle biopsies before and after exercise, electron microscopy to visualize cellular structures, 23-Na-MRI to measure sodium levels in muscle, and exercise tests that assess metabolic function in patients with PCS and ME/CFS.
- **What has been found?**
Recent studies provide direct evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and physical damage in the skeletal muscle of ME/CFS patients, particularly in the area just under the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal). This damage, which includes tissue necrosis after exercise, was not observed in non-ME/CFS Post-COVID patients. Furthermore, MRI studies have confirmed elevated sodium levels within the muscle cells of ME/CFS patients, supporting the theory that an exercise-induced ion imbalance (sodium and calcium overload) is the primary cause of the mitochondrial and muscle damage, as other potential causes like viral presence or myositis have been ruled out.
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose that ME/CFS can be understood as an "acquired ischemic mitochondrial myopathy," a muscle disease caused by poor blood flow and mitochondrial damage. They describe a vicious cycle where an initial vascular problem (common in acute COVID-19) triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further impair blood flow, making the condition chronic and self-sustaining. Risk factors like autoantibodies and certain genetic predispositions may explain why only a subset of Post-COVID patients transition to ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that a self-reproducing cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle is the central mechanism driving ME/CFS and its hallmark symptoms of exertional intolerance and PEM. They suggest that future treatments should focus on breaking this cycle by improving vascular perfusion and normalizing the ionic imbalance in muscles, rather than targeting the original infection. Promising therapeutic strategies under investigation include drugs that improve blood flow, like Mestinon ðŸ’Š and vericiguat ðŸ’Š, and treatments that neutralize harmful autoantibodies.
- **Summary:**
This review presents a compelling model that places skeletal muscle at the heart of ME/CFS pathophysiology. It argues that during exertion, insufficient blood flow causes a toxic buildup of calcium inside muscle cells, which damages their energy-producing mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage creates the profound energy deficit that defines post-exertional malaise. The process becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, explaining the chronic nature of the illness. This framework provides a concrete biological explanation for the disease's core symptoms and identifies clear, promising targets for future drug development aimed at improving muscle blood flow and protecting mitochondria.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists have gathered strong evidence that in ME/CFS, muscles are damaged during physical activity due to poor blood flow. This harms the cells' tiny powerhouses, called mitochondria, leading to a severe energy crisis that explains post-exertional malaise. This process can become a vicious cycle, which is why the illness is chronic and points toward future treatments to improve muscle blood flow.

### 2024-01-06 Advancing Research and Treatment: An Overview of Clinical Trials in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Future Perspectives

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Katharine A. Seton, JosÃ© A. Espejo-Oltra, Karen GimÃ©nez-Orenga, Rik Haagmans, Donia J. Ramadan, Jesper Mehlsen
    - **Institutes:** Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park; Max DelbrÃ¼ck Center for Molecular Medicine; Department of Pathology, School of Health Sciences, Universidad CatÃ³lica de Valencia.
    - **Publisher:** Journal of Clinical Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13020325)
- **What was researched?**
This paper provides a comprehensive review of clinical trials conducted over the last 33 years for ME/CFS. It synthesizes findings from studies on pharmacological drugs and dietary supplements that target dysfunctions in the immunological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. The review also offers recommendations for designing more effective future clinical trials.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a chronic, debilitating illness with no cure or FDA-approved treatment, and fewer than 5% of patients recover to their pre-illness activity levels. Past recommended treatments like Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) have been removed from guidelines due to evidence refuting their safety and efficacy. This creates an urgent need to evaluate the existing body of clinical trial evidence to identify promising research directions and improve the quality of future studies.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that evaluates and summarizes past clinical trials in ME/CFS. The authors systematically analyzed studies investigating various interventions, grouping them based on the biological system they aimed to treat (e.g., antivirals for infection, immunosuppressants for autoimmunity). The paper also critically assesses the types of outcome measures used in ME/CFS research, comparing subjective patient-reported questionnaires to objective measurements.
- **What has been found?**
The review identified several interventions with promising but not yet definitive results that require larger trials. Antivirals like valacyclovir (VACV) ðŸ’Š, valganciclovir (VGCV) ðŸ’Š, and artesunate ðŸ’Š showed some efficacy in patients with evidence of herpesvirus reactivation. Metabolic supplements such as L-carnitine ðŸ’Š, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) ðŸ’Š, NADH ðŸ’Š, and D-ribose ðŸ’Š improved symptoms like fatigue and pain in some studies. Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š showed promise for improving energy, sleep, and pain in retrospective reports. The immunomodulator rintatolimod ðŸ’Š is the only drug to have successfully completed a Phase III trial, showing improved exercise tolerance, but it remains an experimental drug in most countries. Many other interventions, including rituximab and various probiotics, yielded mixed or negative results in larger trials.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight significant limitations in past ME/CFS research, particularly the overwhelming reliance on subjective Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). They argue that these questionnaires are prone to bias and may not be reliable or valid in the ME/CFS population, as demonstrated by studies where open-label trials showed positive results that were not replicated in subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The review also notes that many promising findings come from small or open-label studies, emphasizing the need for larger, more rigorous validation.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that rintatolimod is the most successful treatment investigated to date, though it is not widely available. They strongly recommend that future clinical trials be more robustly designed, utilizing stringent case definitions that include post-exertional malaise (PEM) as a core symptom. The paper calls for a shift away from subjective questionnaires toward objective outcome measures, such as accelerometers to monitor physical activity, and suggests that trials should focus on specific, evidence-based patient subgroups to improve the chances of success.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive review of over three decades of ME/CFS clinical trials provides a critical overview of what has been tested and where research should go next. While no single cure has been found, the paper identifies several promising avenues, including treatments targeting viral infections, immune dysfunction, and cellular energy metabolism, that have shown benefits for at least some patients. The most important contribution of this work is its clear roadmap for improving future research: scientists must conduct larger, better-designed trials on well-defined patient groups and use objective data, like from activity trackers, to prove a treatment works. This approach is essential for moving past the inconsistent results of the past and developing the first evidence-based, approved treatments for ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed over 30 years of studies to identify treatments that have helped people with ME/CFS. They found that some drugs targeting viruses, the immune system, and energy production have shown promise, but require more investigation. The paper concludes that future research must be better designed, using objective tools like activity trackers, to find effective treatments.

### 2023-12-27 Identification of CD8 T-cell dysfunction associated with symptoms in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID and treatment with a nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen agent in a retrospective case series

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Gil, Anna; Hoag, George E.; Salerno, John P.
    - **Institutes:** University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Department of Pathology; Inspiritol, Inc.; The Salerno Center for Complementary Medicine.
    - **Publisher:** Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2023.100720)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the function of a specific type of immune cell, the CD8 T-cell, in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID compared to healthy individuals. It also retrospectively analyzed whether a nebulized treatment with antioxidant and anti-pathogen properties could improve both this immune cell dysfunction and patient-reported symptoms.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS and Long COVID share many symptoms and are often triggered by infections, suggesting they may have a common underlying pathology involving a dysregulated immune system. Researchers hypothesized that an aberrant immune response leads to CD8 T-cell dysfunction, similar to the "T-cell exhaustion" seen in chronic viral infections. This study aimed to identify a specific biomarker for these conditions and explore a potential multi-mechanism treatment targeting oxidative stress and immune dysregulation.
- **How was it researched?**
The study involved two parts. First, a laboratory analysis was conducted on fresh blood samples from 12 ME/CFS patients, 8 Long COVID patients, and 10 healthy controls to measure CD8 T-cell function via intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Second, it presented a retrospective case series of 8 of these patients (4 ME/CFS, 4 Long COVID) who independently chose to use a nebulized treatment, Inspiritol, for a period of 3-15 months. Researchers reviewed changes in their T-cell function and symptom severity scores over the course of the treatment.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that CD8 T-cells from both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients had a significantly diminished capacity to produce the cytokines IFNy and TNFa after stimulation compared to healthy controls, confirming a state of immune dysfunction. In the retrospective case series of 8 patients treated with a nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen agent (Inspiritol) ðŸ’Š, there was an observed improvement in this CD8 T-cell function that occurred in parallel with symptom improvement. On average, these patients reported a 54% decrease in overall symptom severity, and no serious treatment-associated side effects were noted.
- **Discussion:**
The authors suggest that the observed CD8 T-cell dysfunction is a fundamental aspect of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, potentially explaining the body's inability to control latent pathogens. They note that the multi-component nature of the nebulized agent, which has antioxidant, anti-pathogen, and immunomodulatory properties, may address several underlying mechanisms of the diseases simultaneously. The primary limitation is the small number of patients in the retrospective, uncontrolled case series, which means the results are preliminary.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that CD8 T-cell dysfunction appears to be a key feature of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, and that this measurement has potential as a diagnostic and treatment-tracking biomarker. The positive results from the retrospective case series, although preliminary, support advancing the nebulized agent into larger, controlled clinical trials to formally evaluate its safety and efficacy for both conditions.
- **Summary:**
This study provides evidence for a specific, measurable dysfunction in the immune systems of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, where key "killer" T-cells (CD8 T-cells) appear exhausted and are unable to function properly. This finding could lead to the development of a standardized, objective blood test to aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, the paper presents preliminary but encouraging results from a small group of patients who used a novel nebulized treatment and experienced significant symptom reduction alongside a partial reversal of this immune dysfunction. While not a cure, this research opens a new avenue for therapies that target immune modulation and oxidative stress, though these findings must be validated in larger clinical trials.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists have identified a specific defect in the immune cells of people with ME/CFS and Long COVID, which may help explain the illness. This discovery could be used to create a new blood test to help with diagnosis. In a small, preliminary study, a nebulized antioxidant treatment appeared to improve both this immune defect and patient symptoms, opening a new path for future research.

### 2023-10-01 Methylprednisolone in Patients with Cognitive Deficits in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PCS)

- **Overview:**
    - **Trial ID:** NCT05986422
    - **Link:** https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05986422
    - **Sponsor / Lead:** CharitÃ© University, Berlin, Germany
    - **Location(s):** Berlin, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 2
    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-10-01
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31
- **Purpose of the Trial:**
This trial is investigating if Methylprednisolone ðŸ’Š, a well-known immunosuppressant drug, can improve cognitive problems (like memory issues), fatigue, and quality of life in people with Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PCS). The study is based on the idea that some PCS symptoms may be caused by an autoimmune reaction. The goal is to see if suppressing the immune system with this drug offers a therapeutic benefit for these specific symptoms.
- **Trial Design & Procedure:**
    - **Duration:** 52 weeks.
    - **Design:** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants are randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants, the investigators, nor the outcome assessors know who is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo (a substance with no active ingredient).
    - **Groups:** Participants will be split into two groups. One group will receive Methylprednisolone and the other will receive a matching placebo.

### 2023-06-22 Study to Investigate Improvement in Physical Function in SF-36 With Vericiguat Compared With Placebo in Participants With Post-COVID-19 Syndrome

- **Overview:**
    - **Trial ID:** NCT05697640
    - **Link:** https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05697640
    - **Sponsor / Lead:** CharitÃ© University, Berlin, Germany
    - **Location(s):** Berlin, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 2
    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-06-22
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31
- **Purpose of the Trial:**
This trial aims to see if an approved drug called Vericiguat ðŸ’Š can relieve profound fatigue and other symptoms in people with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), including those who meet the criteria for ME/CFS. The study is based on the theory that impaired blood flow in small blood vessels contributes to PCS symptoms. Vericiguat is believed to improve this blood flow, which may lead to a reduction in symptoms like fatigue and an improvement in physical function.
- **Trial Design & Procedure:**
    - **Duration:** Approximately 18 weeks.
    - **Design:** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants are randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants nor the investigators know who is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo (a substance with no active ingredient).
    - **Groups:** Participants will be split into two groups. One group will receive Vericiguat, and the other group will receive a matching placebo.
    - **Procedure:** The treatment involves taking one oral tablet daily for 10 weeks. The dose will be gradually increased over the first four weeks. After the 10-week treatment period, there will be a 30-day follow-up period.
- **Key Eligibility Criteria:**
    - **Who may be eligible to participate? (Key Inclusion Criteria)**
        - Adults aged 18 to 50 years.
        - Confirmed previous mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection (non-hospitalized).
        - Ongoing symptoms of Post-COVID Syndrome (with or without ME/CFS) for at least 6 months.
        - Must show evidence of endothelial dysfunction (impaired function of the inner lining of small blood vessels).
        - Bell Score between 30 and 60, indicating moderate to severe illness.
    - **Who is likely not eligible? (Key Exclusion Criteria)**
        - Individuals with a history of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome before their COVID-19 infection.
        - Systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg at screening.
        - Currently using PDE-5 inhibitors (like sildenafil, tadalafil) or nitrates.
        - Received a COVID-19 vaccination within 4 weeks before joining the study.
        - Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether early outpatient treatment for acute COVID-19 with one of three medicationsâ€”metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamineâ€”could reduce the incidence of a subsequent diagnosis of post-COVID-19 condition (Long COVID) over a 10-month follow-up period.
- **Why was it researched?**
Long COVID is a significant and emerging public health crisis, yet few randomized trials have assessed whether early treatments for the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can prevent its long-term consequences. This research was motivated by the urgent need to find a safe, affordable, and globally available intervention to reduce the risk of developing this chronic condition.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a large, remote (decentralised), randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted in the USA. The study included 1,126 adults aged 30-85 with overweight or obesity who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms for less than a week. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either metformin ðŸ’Š, ivermectin, fluvoxamine, or a matching placebo, and were followed for up to 300 days to see if they received a Long COVID diagnosis from a medical provider.
- **What has been found?**
Early outpatient treatment with metformin ðŸ’Š significantly reduced the incidence of Long COVID. The cumulative incidence of a Long COVID diagnosis by day 300 was 6.3% in the metformin group compared to 10.4% in the placebo group, representing a 41% reduction in risk. The beneficial effect was even stronger when metformin was started within three days of symptom onset. In contrast, neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed any effect on reducing the incidence of Long COVID compared to placebo.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that a major strength of the study is its randomized, quadruple-blind design, which limits potential bias. A limitation is the potential for selection bias, as trial participants may not represent the general population. The study also excluded adults with a normal BMI or those under 30, so it is unknown if the findings apply to these groups.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that early outpatient treatment with metformin during an acute COVID-19 infection effectively reduces the risk of developing Long COVID. Fluvoxamine and ivermectin were not effective for this purpose. The researchers suggest future trials are needed to assess therapeutics for Long COVID prevention in other populations, including those who are vaccinated or have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infections.
- **Summary:**
This is a landmark study as it is the first large-scale randomized trial to show that an existing, safe, and low-cost medication can prevent Long COVID. The findings suggest that taking metformin ðŸ’Š early during a COVID-19 infection could cut the risk of developing long-term symptoms by over 40%. This provides a potential and immediately actionable strategy to mitigate the long-term public health burden of COVID-19, though further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness across different populations, such as those who are vaccinated or not overweight.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested three different drugs to see if taking them during a COVID-19 infection could prevent Long COVID. They found that metformin, a safe and inexpensive drug normally used for diabetes, significantly reduced the chance of getting Long COVID. The other two drugs tested, ivermectin and fluvoxamine, did not show any benefit.

- **Overview:**
    - **Trial ID:** NCT05638633
    - **Link:** https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638633
    - **Sponsor / Lead:** Wuerzburg University Hospital
    - **Location(s):** Kiel, Tuebingen, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 3
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Start Date:** 2022-11-11
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-01-30
- **Purpose of the Trial:**
This trial investigated the effectiveness of treating Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PC19S) with the corticosteroid Prednisolone ðŸ’Š and a Vitamin B compound ðŸ’Š (B1, B6, B12). The study aimed to determine if these treatments, known for their anti-inflammatory and nerve-supporting properties respectively, could alleviate disabling symptoms like fatigue, cognitive issues, and shortness of breath in affected patients.

### 2022-05-09 The Pathobiology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: The Case for Neuroglial Failure

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Herbert Renz-Polster, Marie-Eve Tremblay, Dorothee Bienzle, Joachim E. Fischer
    - **Institutes:** Division of General Medicine, Center for Preventive Medicine and Digital Health Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (CPD-BW), University Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University; Axe Neurosciences, Centre de Recherche du CHU de QuÃ©bec, UniversitÃ© Laval; DÃ©partement de MÃ©decine MolÃ©culaire, UniversitÃ© Laval.
    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.888232)
- **What was researched?**
This paper explores the hypothesis that a dysfunction of neurogliaâ€”the support and immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) such as astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytesâ€”could be the common underlying cause for the wide range of biological abnormalities observed in ME/CFS. The authors reviewed existing scientific literature to test whether this "neuroglial failure" model could explain the two most defining features of the illness: post-exertional malaise (PEM) and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF).
- **Why was it researched?**
While numerous potential disease mechanisms for ME/CFS have been identified, including immune, metabolic, and vascular problems, it remains unclear how these different pathways are connected. Glial cell dysfunction has been previously suggested as a key feature of ME/CFS, but a comprehensive review was lacking. This paper aimed to provide a unifying hypothesis that could connect these disparate findings into a single, cohesive pathobiological framework.
- **How was it researched?**
This study was a hypothesis and theory paper based on a non-systematic literature review. The authors analyzed and synthesized existing research on the clinical and pathobiological features of ME/CFS. They focused specifically on whether the core characteristics of PEM and abnormal CBF could be mechanistically explained by the known functions and dysfunctions of neuroglial cells.
- **What has been found?**
The review concludes that neuroglial dysfunction provides a plausible explanation for the core features of ME/CFS. The authors propose that in ME/CFS, neuroglial cells exist in a "primed" or hyper-reactive state, which would explain the delayed onset, prolonged duration, and multi-systemic nature of PEM as a response to various stressors. Furthermore, since glial cells are central to regulating blood flow in the brain through neurovascular coupling and the baroreflex, their dysfunction would directly account for the consistently observed deficits in cerebral blood flow.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations to their hypothesis that require further investigation. The presence of CNS inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in ME/CFS has not yet been definitively proven. Additionally, the specific roles and interactions of the different glial cell populations (microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) in the disease process remain to be defined.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that regulatory failure of the CNS due to dysfunctional neuroglia may be the central process that orchestrates the clinical presentation of ME/CFS. This model links peripheral issues like immune and endothelial dysfunction to a central mechanism. The authors propose a greater research focus on the role of neuroglia in ME/CFS and suggest re-examining existing therapies that may target these cells, such as minocycline ðŸ’Š, aripiprazole ðŸ’Š, and low dose naltrexone ðŸ’Š.
- **Summary:**
This paper offers a unifying theory that places malfunctioning brain immune cells, known as neuroglia, at the center of ME/CFS pathology. It suggests these cells are stuck in a hyper-reactive state, providing a potential biological reason for post-exertional malaise and the widespread problems with brain blood flow. This "neuroglial failure" hypothesis does not dismiss other findings like mitochondrial or vascular issues, but rather proposes a central mechanism in the brain that connects them. This provides a valuable framework that could help guide future research toward developing treatments that specifically target the neuro-immune interface of the central nervous system.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists propose a new theory that ME/CFS may be caused by malfunctioning support and immune cells in the brain. This malfunction could explain key symptoms like post-exertional malaise and reduced blood flow to the brain. This idea helps connect many different research findings and gives scientists a new target to study for future treatments.

### 2022-03-31 Plasma metabolomics reveals disrupted response and recovery following maximal exercise in myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Arnaud Germain, Ludovic Giloteaux, Geoffrey E. Moore, Susan M. Levine, John K. Chia, Betsy A. Keller, Jared Stevens, Carl J. Franconi, Xiangling Mao, Dikoma C. Shungu, Andrew Grimson, Maureen R. Hanson

    - **Publisher:** JCI Insight
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.157621)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the changes in 1,157 plasma metabolites in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls in response to an exercise challenge. The researchers monitored these changes before and after two maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by 24 hours, a protocol specifically designed to provoke post-exertional malaise (PEM) in patients.
- **Why was it researched?**
PEM is a hallmark symptom of ME/CFS, yet its underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. While previous studies have analyzed the metabolome of ME/CFS patients at rest, none had tracked the metabolic changes over time following a standardized exercise stressor intended to induce PEM. This research aimed to identify the specific metabolic disruptions that occur during the response to and recovery from exertion.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a longitudinal study analyzing blood samples from 60 ME/CFS patients and 45 healthy, sedentary controls. Participants performed two maximal-effort CPETs on a stationary bike, 24 hours apart. Plasma samples were collected at four key time points: before and after exercise on day 1, and before and after exercise on day 2. The relative levels of 1,157 metabolites were then measured and analyzed using advanced statistical and pathway analysis methods to compare the metabolic response and recovery patterns between the two groups.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that the metabolic differences between ME/CFS patients and controls became more pronounced after the exercise challenges. The 24-hour recovery period was particularly abnormal in the ME/CFS cohort, with over a quarter of the identified metabolic pathways being statistically different from controls. Many of these disrupted pathways, including those for lipids and energy, appeared to be connected through glutamate metabolism. The study also highlighted that a large percentage of the most significantly different metabolites between groups were of unknown chemical identity.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that their findings at baseline are consistent with previous ME/CFS metabolomics literature, which has pointed to dysregulation in amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism. The study's strength lies in its longitudinal design using an exercise stressor, which revealed accumulating metabolic disturbances not apparent in a resting state. A noted limitation was the small size of the male cohort, which hindered the statistical power to draw firm conclusions about sex-specific differences, although trends were observed.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that ME/CFS patients exhibit a profoundly disrupted metabolic response and recovery following exertion, providing insight into the molecular changes that likely contribute to PEM. Future work requires large-scale studies to confirm these findings and to identify the unknown metabolites that were significantly altered, which may play a critical role in the disease's mechanisms.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong, objective evidence for the biological reality of post-exertional malaise. It shows that the bodies of people with ME/CFS do not just respond differently to exercise but, more importantly, fail to recover properly on a metabolic level, with abnormalities worsening 24 hours later. The research points to a central disruption in how the body manages energy and building blocks, with glutamate-related pathways emerging as a key area of dysfunction. While not identifying a simple diagnostic test, this work demonstrates that a dynamic stress test is far more revealing than a static one and opens new avenues for understanding and potentially treating the metabolic chaos that follows exertion in ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists measured over a thousand substances in the blood of patients before and after two days of exercise tests. They discovered that while healthy people's bodies recovered, the metabolism of patients became even more disrupted 24 hours later. This finding helps explain the biological basis of post-exertional malaise and points to specific problems with energy production.

### 2020-02-06 An Isolated Complex V Inefficiency and Dysregulated Mitochondrial Function in Immortalized Lymphocytes from ME/CFS Patients

    - **Publisher:** International Journal of Molecular Sciences
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21031074)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated mitochondrial function and cellular stress signaling pathways in immortalized lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) from ME/CFS patients.  The primary goal was to clarify the nature of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS, given the inconsistent findings in previous research. 
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous studies on mitochondrial function in ME/CFS have produced conflicting results, with some reporting reduced function and others finding no significant changes.  The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies might be due to the use of *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which are metabolically inactive and die more rapidly in samples from ME/CFS patients.  To address this, they used metabolically active, immortalized lymphoblasts as a more stable model to reexamine energy metabolism in ME/CFS. 
- **How was it researched?**
This was an *in vitro* laboratory study analyzing immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from 51 ME/CFS patients and 22 healthy controls.  The researchers used Seahorse extracellular flux analysis to measure mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) and glycolysis.  They also employed whole-cell proteomics and biochemical assays to measure the expression of mitochondrial proteins, steady-state ATP levels, mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and the activity of the TORC1 stress-sensing pathway. 
- **What has been found?**
The study identified an isolated inefficiency in Complex V, the final component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for ATP synthesis.  Although this reduced the efficiency of energy production, ME/CFS cells compensated by upregulating the expression and capacity of other respiratory complexes (I, II, and IV) and increasing their use of fatty acids for fuel.  This compensation successfully maintained normal ATP levels at rest, but was associated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chronically hyperactivated TORC1 stress signaling. 
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose that their use of metabolically active lymphoblasts provides a clearer picture than studies using quiescent *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which they found have a higher death rate in ME/CFS samples and may have confounded previous results.  They suggest the observed Complex V inefficiency is likely due to a dysregulation of its activity rather than a genetic defect.  The overall pattern of changes, including the compensatory upregulation of other mitochondrial components, is distinct from findings in other neurological diseases, suggesting a specific pathological mechanism in ME/CFS. 
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that ME/CFS lymphoblasts exhibit a primary inefficiency in Complex V, leading to a cascade of homeostatic compensations that maintain energy levels in a resting state.  However, because these compensatory pathways are already chronically activated, the cells may be unable to respond to acute increases in energy demand, which could be a cellular basis for post-exertional malaise.  The authors suggest future work should investigate the cause of the Complex V dysfunction and examine whether these findings are replicated in other cell types. 
- **Summary:**
This study identifies a specific problem at the very end of the cellular energy production line (Complex V) in ME/CFS patient immune cells. While the cells successfully compensate for this inefficiency at rest by over-activating other parts of the energy pathway, this state of constant compensation may exhaust their ability to ramp up energy production when needed, such as during physical or mental exertion. This finding provides a potential cellular explanation for post-exertional malaise and other symptoms of energy impairment. By pinpointing a specific molecular inefficiency rather than a general mitochondrial failure, this research offers a more focused target for the development of future diagnostic biomarkers and treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists discovered a specific inefficiency in the final step of energy production within immune cells from ME/CFS patients. The cells work overtime to make up for this problem, keeping energy levels normal when at rest. This constant state of compensation may be why the cells can't produce extra energy when needed, potentially explaining the severe fatigue after exertion.

### 2019-07-04 Post-Exertional Malaise Is Associated with Hypermetabolism, Hypoacetylation and Purine Metabolism Deregulation in ME/CFS Cases

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Neil R. McGregor, Christopher W. Armstrong, Donald P. Lewis, Paul R. Gooley
    - **Institutes:** Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biochemistry Institute; CFS Discovery, Donvale Medical Centre.
    - **Publisher:** Diagnostics
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics9030070)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the biochemical changes in the blood and urine of ME/CFS patients to identify metabolic signatures associated with the severity of post-exertional malaise (PEM) experienced in the previous seven days. The researchers aimed to understand the underlying pathophysiology of PEM, a core symptom of the illness.
- **Why was it researched?**
While PEM is a defining characteristic of ME/CFS, very little is known about its biological basis. Previous research indicated that ME/CFS patients have dysregulated energy metabolism, including problems with glycolysis (breaking down sugar for energy) and purine metabolism (related to ATP, the cell's energy currency). This study was designed to specifically link these previously observed biochemical anomalies to the acute experience of PEM.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an observational study analyzing blood and urine samples from 46 ME/CFS patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The ME/CFS group was further divided into 35 patients who had experienced PEM within the last 7 days (the "PEM group") and 11 who had not. Researchers used questionnaires to score PEM severity and frequency, and metabolomics (the large-scale study of small molecules) to analyze the biochemical differences between the groups.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that the severity of PEM in the last 7 days was associated with a "hypermetabolic event" characterized by the increased excretion of multiple metabolites in the urine. Key findings included increased urinary excretion of methylhistidine (a marker for muscle protein breakdown), mannitol (a marker for intestinal barrier dysfunction or "leaky gut"), and acetate. The primary biochemical change linked to PEM severity was a significant drop in the serum level of hypoxanthine, a crucial component of purine metabolism needed for energy production. These findings point towards a state of hypoacetylation (low acetate availability) and dysregulated energy production during PEM.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the small study size and the potential for recall bias from using self-reported symptom questionnaires. The study was designed as an exploratory investigation to generate a hypothesis, rather than to test a pre-existing one. Therefore, the findings need to be confirmed in larger, multi-center studies that can further validate the identified biochemical changes.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that PEM is associated with significant disruptions in glycolysis, acetylation, and purine metabolism. This suggests a state of hypoacetylation occurs, which can profoundly impact cellular functions, including gene expression and enzyme activity. The researchers call for future studies to directly evaluate acetylation processes and their consequences in ME/CFS patients to better understand the mechanisms of PEM and develop appropriate therapies.
- **Summary:**
This research provides a potential biological explanation for the "crash" experienced during PEM. It suggests that exertion triggers a hypermetabolic state in ME/CFS patients, causing their bodies to wastefully excrete vital moleculesâ€”including those needed for cellular regulation (acetate) and energy (purines)â€”through their urine. This process is linked to evidence of muscle breakdown and leaky gut. The resulting lack of key molecules like acetate (hypoacetylation) could disrupt a vast range of cellular activities, offering a reason for the widespread symptoms of PEM. These findings offer specific biochemical targets for future research into diagnostics and treatments and provide a scientific basis for why graded exercise may be physically harmful for patients.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists found that after exertion, the bodies of ME/CFS patients go into an overdrive state, causing them to lose key molecules through their urine. This process appears to be connected to muscle breakdown, leaky gut, and problems with how cells produce energy. These findings help explain the biological cause of post-exertional malaise and show why pushing through activity could be physically damaging.

    - **Link:** [Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274235/)
- **What was researched?**
This Institute of Medicine (IOM) report outlines the work of an expert committee charged with evaluating the numerous existing diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Based on a comprehensive evidence review, the committee's objective was to develop new, evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria, recommend whether a new name for the illness was warranted, and propose a strategy for disseminating their findings to healthcare professionals. 
- **Why was it researched?**
The study was commissioned because diagnosing ME/CFS is a persistent challenge, leading to long delays and a high rate of undiagnosed patients, estimated to be between 84 and 91 percent. Existing case definitions were numerous, varied, and often conflicting, causing confusion for clinicians and researchers. This situation, coupled with skepticism in the medical community, prompted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with the IOM to develop clearer, consensus-based criteria to improve the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis and patient care. 
- **How was it researched?**
This was a consensus study based on a comprehensive literature review. The IOM convened a 15-member committee with expertise in ME/CFS and related fields. The committee systematically reviewed scientific literature published since 1950, heard testimony from patients, advocates, and scientific experts, and considered hundreds of public comments. An adapted "GRADE grid" was used to formally assess the evidence for various symptoms, and the final recommendations for new diagnostic criteria were reached through a consensus-building methodology among the entire committee. 
- **What has been found?**
The committee proposed new, more focused diagnostic criteria requiring three core symptoms: 1) a substantial reduction in pre-illness activity levels lasting more than 6 months, accompanied by profound, new-onset fatigue not alleviated by rest; 2) post-exertional malaise (PEM); and 3) unrefreshing sleep. In addition, a diagnosis requires at least one of two other manifestations: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. The committee also concluded that the name "chronic fatigue syndrome" is stigmatizing and trivializing, and that "myalgic encephalomyelitis" is not well supported by evidence; they recommended renaming the illness "systemic exertion intolerance disease" (SEID). 
- **Discussion:**
The committee noted that a significant challenge in their work was the methodological limitations of the existing ME/CFS research base. They highlighted the heterogeneity in patient and control groups across studies, the use of many different and sometimes unvalidated measures for symptoms, and the lack of properly matched control groups (e.g., patients with other fatiguing illnesses). The committee was also struck by the overall paucity of research funding and studies conducted to date, which limited their ability to define disease subgroups or the natural history of the illness. 
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The committee concluded that ME/CFS is a serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease and that their proposed evidence-based criteria will enable clinicians to make more accurate and timely diagnoses. They recommended that a multidisciplinary group should reexamine and update these new criteria in no more than 5 years, as new research becomes available. The report emphasizes that more research is essential to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of the disease. 
- **Summary:**
This landmark report from the Institute of Medicine provides strong validation for the severity and legitimacy of ME/CFS, directly addressing the skepticism that patients often face. By proposing new diagnostic criteria centered on core, debilitating symptoms like post-exertional malaise, it provides clinicians with a clearer path to diagnosis, potentially reducing the years-long diagnostic delays many patients endure. The recommendation to rename the illness "systemic exertion intolerance disease" (SEID) is a direct attempt to reduce stigma and better reflect the central role of exertion intolerance in the disease's pathology. For patients, this report represents a crucial step toward improved medical recognition, more accurate diagnoses, and a stronger foundation for future research into treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
A major U.S. medical institute has confirmed that ME/CFS is a serious and complex physical illness. They have created new, clearer diagnostic rules for doctors that focus on core symptoms like the severe worsening of symptoms after minimal exertion. The experts also recommended changing the name to "systemic exertion intolerance disease" to better describe the condition and reduce stigma.
