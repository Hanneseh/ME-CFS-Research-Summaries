## Summary

This research offers a new way to categorize ME/CFS patients by linking traditional clinical observations with microscopic protein modifications. By identifying unique biological markers for different syndrome types, it supports the move toward personalized medicine for complex chronic illnesses. This bridge between Eastern and Western medical frameworks could improve diagnostic accuracy and help target therapies more effectively.

## What was researched?

The study investigated differences in histone phosphorylation and protein expression in the immune cells of patients with ME/CFS. It specifically focused on comparing two common Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome types with healthy controls.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers aimed to find objective biological mechanisms underlying TCM-defined fatigue patterns. Understanding these epigenetic modifications could help bridge the gap between traditional diagnoses and modern molecular biology.

## How was it researched?

This case-control study analyzed 30 participants divided into three groups: healthy controls, patients with Qi and Blood Deficiency, and patients with Liver Depression and Spleen Deficiency. Researchers utilized phosphopeptide enrichment and Gene Ontology analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins and biological pathways.

## What has been found?

Significant differences were found in intracellular signal transduction and the organization of the cortical cytoskeleton between patients and controls. Specific variations in histone phosphorylation patterns were observed between the two TCM syndrome types, involving processes like actin filament bundling and presynaptic modulation.

## Discussion

The study is limited by its small sample size of ten participants per group. However, its strength lies in identifying specific molecular differences that correspond to traditional diagnostic categories.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The research demonstrates that histone phosphorylation is closely linked to the development of ME/CFS. The findings suggest that epigenetic profiling could eventually lead to more personalized treatments for the condition.
