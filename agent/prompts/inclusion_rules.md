<inclusion_criteria>
Prioritize papers that meet ONE or more of these criteria:

1. **Biomedical Focus**:
   - **Mechanisms**: Immunology, Metabolomics, Neurology, Genetics, Virology (e.g., EBV reactivation, HERV).
   - **Pathophysiology**: Mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, clotting/microclots, brain hypometabolism.

2. **Advanced Phenotyping & Subtyping** (High Priority):
   - Studies using **Machine Learning**, **Cluster Analysis**, or latent class analysis to identify distinct patient subtypes, severity groups, or phenotype clusters.
   - *Rationale*: ME/CFS is heterogeneous; data-driven subtyping is critical to resolving the "mixed cohort" problem.
   - *Note*: Include high-quality Long COVID (PASC) studies if they identify ME/CFS-like phenotypes (e.g., PEM, POTS subtypes) via these methods.

3. **Diagnostics & Biomarkers**:
   - Discovery or validation of blood/tissue/imaging biomarkers.
   - Provocation studies (e.g., CPET, tilt table) demonstrating objective abnormalities (e.g., reduction in anaerobic threshold).

4. **Treatments**:
   - Pharmacological interventions (repurposed drugs, novel compounds).
   - Immune modulation (e.g., BC007, IVIG, apheresis).
   - Pathogen targeting (antivirals).

5. **Strict Case Definitions**:
   - Usage of CCC (Canadian Consensus Criteria), ICC, or IOM/NAM criteria.
</inclusion_criteria>

<exclusion_criteria>
Reject papers that meet ANY of these criteria:

1. **Psychosomatic/Behavioral Models**:
   - Framing ME/CFS/Long COVID as "functional neurologic disorder" (FND), "bodily distress syndrome", or primarily driven by "fear avoidance", deconditioning, or "unhelpful beliefs".

2. **Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) & CBT for "Cure"**:
   - Studies promoting GET or "reconditioning" as a cure.
   - Studies promoting CBT or "Lightning Process" as curative for the underlying disease.
   - *Exception*: Studies *measuring* PEM via CPET are ACCEPTABLE. Studies *managing* mental health (coping) are acceptable if they don't claim to cure the physical disease.

3. **Vague Criteria**:
   - Studies using the "Oxford criteria" (too broad, includes primary depression).

4. **Low Value / Generic**:
   - Letters to the editor, generic commentaries, or non-systematic reviews without new data/insights.
   - **Simple Descriptive Surveys**: Basic prevalence surveys (e.g., "X% feel tired") without advanced clustering/subtyping or biomedical correlation.
   - Case reports of unrelated diseases (e.g., West Nile, MOGAD, MS) unless explicitly drawing a novel mechanism parallel to ME/CFS.
</exclusion_criteria>

<input_analysis_tips>
- **Long COVID**: Long COVID papers are often also relevant as they investigate mechanisms overlapping with ME/CFS (PEM, dysautonomia, immune dysregulation) or identify ME/CFS-like subgroups.
- **Machine Learning**: If a paper uses ML to find "clusters" or "severity groups" in Post-Acute syndromes, **INCLUDE IT**. This is high-value phenotyping.
