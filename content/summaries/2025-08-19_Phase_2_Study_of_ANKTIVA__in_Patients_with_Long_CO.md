## Summary

This study explores a novel approach to treating Long COVID by using a first-in-class immunotherapy to "jump-start" the immune system. If successful, ANKTIVA® could help clear lingering viral proteins and restore healthy immune function in patients for whom traditional antivirals have failed. This marks a significant shift toward immune-enhancing strategies for chronic post-viral syndromes.

## What was researched?

This study evaluates the safety and immunological effects of ANKTIVA® 💊 (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) in individuals suffering from Long COVID.

## Why was it researched?

The research aims to address persistent viral reservoirs and immune dysregulation, specifically targeting the deficiency in Natural Killer (NK) and T cell activity often observed in Long COVID patients.

## How was it researched?

This is a Phase 2, exploratory, single-arm clinical trial involving up to 40 adult participants who meet the World Health Organization criteria for Long COVID. Participants receive subcutaneous injections of the IL-15 superagonist and undergo monitoring for adverse events and changes in absolute lymphocyte counts.

## What has been found?

As of late 2025, the trial has been initiated and is currently in the recruitment phase at clinical sites in California. Preliminary findings are not yet available, but researchers are tracking the drug's ability to improve post-COVID NK cell and CD8+ T cell counts and function.

## Discussion

The study's single-arm, open-label design is a limitation as it lacks a placebo control for comparison. However, the focus on objective biomarkers like lymphocyte counts provides a quantitative measure of the drug's biological activity in this patient population.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The trial focuses on whether immune modulation via IL-15 agonism can provide a new therapeutic pathway for chronic post-viral conditions. Future results will clarify if boosting NK cell response translates into effective viral clearance and symptom relief.
