- **What was researched?**
This clinical pilot study investigated the safety and feasibility of using the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab ðŸ’Š to target and deplete plasma cells in patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. The researchers also assessed whether this treatment could lead to clinical improvement over a 12 to 24-month follow-up period.
- **Why was it researched?**
The study was based on the hypothesis that ME/CFS is an autoimmune condition driven by functional autoantibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells. Previous trials using the B-cell depleting drug rituximab failed to show a difference from placebo, which the researchers speculate is because rituximab does not affect these long-lived plasma cells. This study aimed to test if directly targeting these antibody-producing cells with daratumumab could be a more effective strategy.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a prospective, open-label pilot trial involving ten female patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. After a 12-week observation period, all patients received injections of daratumumab; six patients received four injections and four patients received a total of seven injections. Clinical outcomes were measured using self-reported questionnaires (SF-36 Physical Function and DSQ-SF), physical activity trackers (Fitbit), and laboratory tests, including immunoglobulin (IgG) and Natural Killer (NK) cell counts.
- **What has been found?**
The treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Six out of the ten patients experienced marked and sustained clinical improvement, with five of them reaching a physical function score close to or within the normal population range by the end of the follow-up. For the six responders, the average physical function score (SF-36 PF) increased from 32.2 to 78.3. The study also found a significant correlation between a higher baseline NK-cell count and a positive clinical response.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the main limitations of the study are the small number of participants (10), the inclusion of only female patients, and the open-label design, which lacks a placebo control group. They suggest the observed association between higher baseline NK-cell counts and clinical improvement may be biologically significant, as NK cells are involved in the drug's mechanism of depleting plasma cells. The dichotomous response patternâ€”either pronounced improvement or no change at allâ€”was a notable observation.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that targeting plasma cells with daratumumab was feasible, safe, and associated with major and durable symptom improvement in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that functional autoantibodies from long-lived plasma cells play a key role in the disease. A larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was launched in June 2025 to confirm these promising results.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong preliminary evidence for the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease driven by autoantibodies. By using a drug that targets the specific immune cells responsible for long-term antibody production, researchers observed significant, life-altering improvements in a majority of the trial participants. The finding that a higher baseline count of Natural Killer (NK) cells was associated with a better outcome could potentially lead to a biomarker to predict who would benefit from this type of treatment. While these results from a small, open-label trial are very encouraging, they must be confirmed in the larger, placebo-controlled trial that is now underway before any definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy can be made.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a drug that targets specific immune cells suspected of causing ME/CFS, based on the theory that it is an autoimmune illness. In this small, initial study of ten women, six experienced significant and lasting improvements in their health. These hopeful results are a promising first step, and a larger, more rigorous study has now begun to verify if the treatment is truly effective.
