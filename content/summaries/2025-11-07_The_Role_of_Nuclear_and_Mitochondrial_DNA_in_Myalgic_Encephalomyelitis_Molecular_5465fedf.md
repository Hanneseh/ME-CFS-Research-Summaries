## Summary

This review consolidates scientific evidence confirming that ME/CFS is a biological illness rooted in an individual's genetics and cellular function. It highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a central explanation for the profound energy deficits and post-exertional malaise. The paper also explains how environmental triggers, like viruses, may cause lasting epigenetic changes (altering how genes are switched on or off), leading to chronic immune dysregulation. By connecting these findings, the research supports the development of objective biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies, such as targeting mitochondrial function with supplements like **Coenzyme Q10** 💊 or **L-carnitine** 💊, or reducing oxidative stress. This integrated understanding is a crucial step toward creating personalized treatments that address the specific molecular issues in ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This paper is a comprehensive literature review that synthesizes current scientific evidence on the role of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in the development and pathology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS). It examines genetic predispositions, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation). The review also explores how these molecular findings could be translated into DNA-based biomarkers for diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating, multisystem disorder, but the specific molecular mechanisms that cause it remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding has hindered the development of reliable diagnostic tests and effective treatments. This review was conducted to consolidate the growing body of research on the genetic and epigenetic factors of ME/CFS to clarify its underlying biology and identify promising paths toward precision medicine.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review, not a new experimental study with patients. The authors gathered and synthesized the latest peer-reviewed evidence from a wide range of existing research. This included foundational research, such as twin studies and candidate gene studies, as well as recent large-scale genomic projects (like DecodeME) and multi-omics analyses. The paper connects findings from genetics, epigenetics, and mitochondrial research to build a cohesive picture of the disease's molecular basis.

## What has been found?

The review confirms that evidence supports a genetic component to ME/CFS, shown by familial clustering and heritability data from twin studies. A central finding is the significant role of mitochondrial dysfunction, which impairs cellular energy (ATP) production and is linked to oxidative stress. The authors also highlight that epigenetic modifications—changes in how genes are expressed without altering the DNA sequence—serve as a key link between environmental triggers (like viruses) and chronic illness. These changes can lead to immune dysregulation and the activation of dormant "transposable elements," which may mimic a viral infection and drive chronic inflammation.

## Discussion

The authors identify several key challenges in translating this research into clinical practice. The primary obstacle is the significant biological heterogeneity among ME/CFS patients, which makes it difficult to find one-size-fits-all biomarkers or treatments. Another major challenge is distinguishing between molecular changes that *cause* the disease and those that are a *consequence* of chronic illness. The review also emphasizes that genetic and epigenetic findings must be replicated across diverse, multi-ethnic populations to ensure they are universally applicable.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that DNA plays a profound and multifaceted role in ME/CFS, involving genetic susceptibility, significant mitochondrial dysfunction, and dynamic epigenetic changes that drive immune and metabolic problems. They strongly advocate for an integrative "multi-omics" approach, which combines genomic, epigenomic, and other molecular data, as crucial for future research. This comprehensive approach is considered essential for discovering objective biomarkers and developing personalized treatments that target the root molecular causes of the disease.
