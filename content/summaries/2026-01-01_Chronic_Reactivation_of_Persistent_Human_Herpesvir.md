## Summary

This research identifies a clear biological signature linking persistent viral activity to the severe fatigue experienced by ME/CFS patients. By demonstrating that most patients have evidence of multiple dormant viruses undergoing abortive reactivation, the study offers a potential new biomarker to test for the disease and group patients by clinical severity. These findings support the theory that ME/CFS is driven by a recurring immune response to viral proteins, which could lead to more targeted diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the presence of IgG antibodies against viral dUTPase proteins from human herpesviruses and endogenous retroviruses in patients with ME/CFS. Researchers specifically examined antibodies related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and HERV-K.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS often follows a viral infection, yet traditional tests frequently fail to find active viral replication. This research focused on 'abortive lytic reactivation,' where viruses produce specific inflammatory proteins like dUTPase without completing a full replication cycle, potentially driving chronic symptoms.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a longitudinal analysis of 873 serum samples from 40 ME/CFS patients and 378 samples from 16 healthy controls. They used Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) to measure specific antibody levels and correlated these findings with the patients' reported fatigue severity using statistical modeling.

## What has been found?

A significant increase in dUTPase IgG antibodies for EBV, HHV-6, and VZV was discovered in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls. Notably, 72.5% of patients simultaneously expressed antibodies to multiple viruses, and these heightened antibody levels were strongly associated with moderate to severe fatigue levels.

## Discussion

The results suggest that chronic, low-level reactivation of several persistent viruses is a recurrent hallmark of the disease. This multi-viral reactivation explains some of the symptom heterogeneity in ME/CFS and highlights the limitations of testing for only one virus at a single point in time.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Herpesvirus dUTPase antibodies are promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and stratification of ME/CFS patients. These findings emphasize the importance of monitoring viral protein responses across different severity groups to improve clinical characterization.
