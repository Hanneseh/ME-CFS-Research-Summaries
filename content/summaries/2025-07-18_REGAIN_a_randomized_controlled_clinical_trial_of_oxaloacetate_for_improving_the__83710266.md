## Summary

This study investigated oxaloacetate, a supplement involved in cellular energy production, as a potential treatment for long COVID. While it failed to significantly improve fatigue according to the main questionnaire, it showed promising results on other fronts. Participants taking oxaloacetate experienced a more rapid reduction in their overall symptom burden and, importantly, showed significant improvements on objective tests of cognitive function, or "brain fog." These cognitive improvements were linked to their symptom improvements, suggesting a real biological effect. Although preliminary, this research highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for addressing the debilitating cognitive deficits in long COVID, warranting further investigation in larger studies.

## What was researched?

This randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial evaluated whether a daily oral dose of oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 could effectively and safely improve fatigue and cognitive function in adults diagnosed with long COVID. The study's primary goal was to measure the reduction in fatigue over a 42-day period.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a persistent and often disabling condition with no widely accepted treatments available. Emerging research suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and altered metabolism may contribute to its symptoms. As oxaloacetate is a key intermediate in cellular energy production and has shown promise in previous trials for reducing fatigue in ME/CFS and long COVID, this study aimed to rigorously test its efficacy.

## How was it researched?

This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial involving 69 adults with long COVID. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2,000 mg/day of oxaloacetate or a placebo (rice flour) for 42 days. The primary outcome was fatigue, measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), while secondary outcomes included symptom burden (DSQ-SF), quality of life (RAND-36), objective cognitive function (DANA Brain Vital), and physical activity (UP Time).

## What has been found?

The study did not find a statistically significant difference in fatigue reduction between the oxaloacetate and placebo groups based on the primary measure (CFQ). However, the group taking OAA showed significantly greater improvements in both fatigue and total symptom burden at day 21 when measured by a different questionnaire (DSQ-SF). Furthermore, the OAA group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in objective measures of cognitive function, and these cognitive gains were strongly correlated with symptom reduction. The treatment was well tolerated.

## Discussion

The authors note that the primary outcome measure, the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), may have lacked the sensitivity to detect treatment effects in the complex long COVID population. They suggest that other multi-domain questionnaires, like the DSQ-SF, might be more appropriate for capturing clinically meaningful changes. Key limitations of the study include its modest sample size, the short 42-day duration which may not have been long enough to observe changes in physical function, and its single-site design.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that although the primary endpoint for fatigue was not met, the positive results from secondary measures provide evidence that oxaloacetate may offer clinically meaningful benefits for improving overall symptom burden and cognitive function in individuals with long COVID. The findings support the need for larger, longer-duration trials using a range of sensitive outcome measures to confirm the efficacy of OAA and to better understand its mechanisms of action.
