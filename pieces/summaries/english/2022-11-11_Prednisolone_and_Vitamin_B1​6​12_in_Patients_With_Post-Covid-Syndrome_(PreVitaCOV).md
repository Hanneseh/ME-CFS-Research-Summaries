- **Overview:**
    - **Trial ID:** NCT05638633
    - **Link:** https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638633
    - **Sponsor / Lead:** Wuerzburg University Hospital
    - **Location(s):** Kiel, Tuebingen, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 3
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Start Date:** 2022-11-11
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-01-30
- **Purpose of the Trial:**
This trial investigated the effectiveness of treating Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PC19S) with the corticosteroid Prednisolone ðŸ’Š and a Vitamin B compound ðŸ’Š (B1, B6, B12). The study aimed to determine if these treatments, known for their anti-inflammatory and nerve-supporting properties respectively, could alleviate disabling symptoms like fatigue, cognitive issues, and shortness of breath in affected patients. The trial tested the medications both individually and in combination against a placebo.
- **Trial Design & Procedure:**
    - **Duration:** The treatment period for participants was 28 days.
    - **Design:** This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants were randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants, care providers, nor investigators knew who was receiving which treatment.
    - **Groups:** Participants were split into four groups: one receiving Prednisolone and a placebo for Vitamin B, one receiving Vitamin B and a placebo for Prednisolone, one receiving both active treatments, and one receiving a placebo for both.
    - **Procedure:** Participants took oral medication daily for 28 days. The Prednisolone group received a higher dose for the first 5 days, followed by a lower dose for the remaining 23 days.
