## Summary

This research represents a pivotal shift toward large-scale, collaborative efforts to solve the mystery of post-infectious syndromes. By comparing ME/CFS and Long Covid side-by-side using the latest molecular technology, the study treats these conditions as part of a broader biological spectrum rather than isolated phenomena. For patients, this means that the massive influx of research interest in Long Covid is being directly applied to ME/CFS, potentially speeding up the discovery of the first objective diagnostic tests. While this is a long-term project, its comprehensive design and high-level institutional support provide a solid foundation for finding actionable treatment targets in the coming years.

## What was researched?

This project, named the Rosetta Stone study, investigates the immunological similarities and differences between ME/CFS and Long Covid. Researchers aim to create a comprehensive cellular and molecular profile of both conditions to identify shared biological pathways and potential diagnostic biomarkers.

## Why was it researched?

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have observed significant clinical and pathological overlaps between ME/CFS and Long Covid, both of which are often triggered by viral infections. Despite these similarities, the underlying immune mechanisms are not fully understood, and there is a critical need for objective diagnostic tools and targeted treatments for both patient populations.

## How was it researched?

This is a three-year, large-scale biomedical study led by Imperial College London in collaboration with multiple UK institutions. The researchers will perform a direct side-by-side comparison of 250 individuals with ME/CFS and 250 individuals with Long Covid, alongside matched healthy controls. The team will analyze blood, stool, and saliva samples using high-resolution molecular techniques and incorporate symptom data collected through the ELAROS smartphone app. The study also leverages genetic data and expertise from existing cohorts, including the DecodeME study and the NIHR WILCO Long Covid study.

## What has been found?

As this announcement marks the launch of the project, the primary "finding" highlighted by the investigators is the established clinical evidence of significant overlap between the two conditions, justifying the largest-ever single investment in ME/CFS biomedical research by a UK charity. The study's design acknowledges that studying these conditions in parallel is the most effective way to uncover the "Rosetta Stone"—a shared biological key—that could explain the mechanisms of post-infectious disability.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that the study's primary strength is its unprecedented scale and its multi-sample approach, which allows for a holistic view of the immune system. They discuss the necessity of this large-scale collaboration to overcome the limitations of smaller, isolated studies that have historically struggled to provide definitive answers for ME/CFS. A potential challenge noted is the complexity of analyzing such a vast amount of data across different biological samples and diverse patient groups.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that mapping the immunological profiles of ME/CFS and Long Covid in tandem is essential for accelerating the development of medical solutions. Future work over the next three years will focus on identifying specific biomarkers and shared pathways that can inform subsequent clinical trials and therapeutic strategies.
