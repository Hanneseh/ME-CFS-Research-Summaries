## Summary

This study provides evidence for a specific autoimmune mechanism in ME/CFS and Post-COVID Syndrome, where the immune system may attack the body's own proteins because they resemble parts of the Epstein-Barr virus. Researchers identified several specific human proteins involved in autonomic, vascular, and neurological function that are targeted by these cross-reactive antibodies. The direct correlation found between the levels of these autoantibodies and the severity of key symptoms like autonomic dysfunction and cognitive issues strengthens the theory that autoimmunity is a significant driver of the illness. This work identifies potential new biomarkers for diagnosis and points toward future treatments that could target these specific autoimmune pathways.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether antibodies targeting specific parts of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) also react with similar-looking human proteins in women with Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). The researchers focused on antibody reactivity to arginine-rich (poly-R) sequences from EBV proteins and their human counterparts, and whether these antibody levels were associated with clinical symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

EBV is a known trigger for ME/CFS and EBV reactivation is a risk factor for PCS. Previous studies by the same research group found that ME/CFS patients have elevated antibody responses to specific arginine-rich parts of EBV proteins. This led to the hypothesis that the immune system, when targeting these viral parts, might mistakenly attack human proteins with similar sequences—a mechanism called molecular mimicry—which could contribute to the autoimmune symptoms seen in both conditions.

## How was it researched?

This was a laboratory study analyzing blood serum from a cohort of 115 female participants: 45 with PCS (26 of whom also met ME/CFS criteria), 36 with post-infectious ME/CFS not triggered by COVID (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls. The researchers used a cytometric bead array (CBA) to measure IgG antibody binding to short peptide sequences from EBV and homologous human proteins. They also used a multiplex dot-blot assay to measure IgG binding to the corresponding full-length proteins and correlated these antibody levels with symptom severity data from patient questionnaires.

## What has been found?

Autoantibodies targeting arginine-rich sequences of several human proteins were found more frequently in the patient groups than in healthy controls. These proteins included the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, the signaling regulator TSPYL2, and the angiogenesis-related protein TSPYL5. Additionally, autoantibodies against full-length α-adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more common in patients. Crucially, the levels of several of these autoantibodies showed positive correlations with the severity of core symptoms, including autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations of this exploratory study, including the relatively small cohort sizes and the restriction to only female participants, which means the findings require validation in larger, more diverse patient groups. They also note that their selection of human proteins to test was based on their potential relevance to ME/CFS symptoms, which may have introduced a bias and excluded other important autoantigens.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that patients with PCS and ME/CFS have a higher frequency of autoantibodies directed against human proteins that contain sequences mimicking those in EBV. The association between these autoantibodies and symptom severity suggests they are functionally relevant and supports the hypothesis that molecular mimicry plays a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. These findings warrant further investigation to confirm the pathogenic role of these autoantibodies and to explore their potential use as diagnostic markers.
