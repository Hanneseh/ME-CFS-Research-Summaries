- **What was researched?**
This paper provides a comprehensive review of clinical trials conducted over the last 33 years for ME/CFS. It synthesizes findings from studies on pharmacological drugs and dietary supplements that target dysfunctions in the immunological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. The review also offers recommendations for designing more effective future clinical trials.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a chronic, debilitating illness with no cure or FDA-approved treatment, and fewer than 5% of patients recover to their pre-illness activity levels. Past recommended treatments like Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) have been removed from guidelines due to evidence refuting their safety and efficacy. This creates an urgent need to evaluate the existing body of clinical trial evidence to identify promising research directions and improve the quality of future studies.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that evaluates and summarizes past clinical trials in ME/CFS. The authors systematically analyzed studies investigating various interventions, grouping them based on the biological system they aimed to treat (e.g., antivirals for infection, immunosuppressants for autoimmunity). The paper also critically assesses the types of outcome measures used in ME/CFS research, comparing subjective patient-reported questionnaires to objective measurements.
- **What has been found?**
The review identified several interventions with promising but not yet definitive results that require larger trials. Antivirals like valacyclovir (VACV) ðŸ’Š, valganciclovir (VGCV) ðŸ’Š, and artesunate ðŸ’Š showed some efficacy in patients with evidence of herpesvirus reactivation. Metabolic supplements such as L-carnitine ðŸ’Š, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) ðŸ’Š, NADH ðŸ’Š, and D-ribose ðŸ’Š improved symptoms like fatigue and pain in some studies. Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š showed promise for improving energy, sleep, and pain in retrospective reports. The immunomodulator rintatolimod ðŸ’Š is the only drug to have successfully completed a Phase III trial, showing improved exercise tolerance, but it remains an experimental drug in most countries. Many other interventions, including rituximab and various probiotics, yielded mixed or negative results in larger trials.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight significant limitations in past ME/CFS research, particularly the overwhelming reliance on subjective Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). They argue that these questionnaires are prone to bias and may not be reliable or valid in the ME/CFS population, as demonstrated by studies where open-label trials showed positive results that were not replicated in subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The review also notes that many promising findings come from small or open-label studies, emphasizing the need for larger, more rigorous validation.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that rintatolimod is the most successful treatment investigated to date, though it is not widely available. They strongly recommend that future clinical trials be more robustly designed, utilizing stringent case definitions that include post-exertional malaise (PEM) as a core symptom. The paper calls for a shift away from subjective questionnaires toward objective outcome measures, such as accelerometers to monitor physical activity, and suggests that trials should focus on specific, evidence-based patient subgroups to improve the chances of success.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive review of over three decades of ME/CFS clinical trials provides a critical overview of what has been tested and where research should go next. While no single cure has been found, the paper identifies several promising avenues, including treatments targeting viral infections, immune dysfunction, and cellular energy metabolism, that have shown benefits for at least some patients. The most important contribution of this work is its clear roadmap for improving future research: scientists must conduct larger, better-designed trials on well-defined patient groups and use objective data, like from activity trackers, to prove a treatment works. This approach is essential for moving past the inconsistent results of the past and developing the first evidence-based, approved treatments for ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed over 30 years of studies to identify treatments that have helped people with ME/CFS. They found that some drugs targeting viruses, the immune system, and energy production have shown promise, but require more investigation. The paper concludes that future research must be better designed, using objective tools like activity trackers, to find effective treatments.
