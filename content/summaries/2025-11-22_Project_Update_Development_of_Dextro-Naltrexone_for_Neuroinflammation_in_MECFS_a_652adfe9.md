## Summary

Dr. Jarred Younger proposes a novel treatment called Dextro-Naltrexone to fix the "brain inflammation" believed to cause ME/CFS. He explains that standard Naltrexone (used in LDN) contains two parts: one that helps inflammation (Dextro) and one that blocks endorphins (Levo). The "Levo" part limits how much medicine a patient can take. By isolating and using *only* the **Dextro-Naltrexone** 💊, patients could potentially take much stronger doses to turn off brain inflammation without blocking their natural painkillers. Since drug companies won't make it due to profit issues, Dr. Younger is manufacturing it himself to run the first clinical trials.

## What was researched?

Dr. Jarred Younger is investigating **Dextro-Naltrexone** (D-Naltrexone), a specific form of the drug naltrexone, as a targeted treatment for brain inflammation (neuroinflammation). He hypothesizes that this drug can treat the root cause of symptoms in ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, and Long COVID by calming overactive brain immune cells (microglia) without the side effects associated with current naltrexone treatments.

## Why was it researched?

Current treatments like **Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)** 💊 help many patients but have a "therapeutic ceiling." Standard naltrexone is a mixture of two mirror-image molecules: *Levo-naltrexone* (which blocks opioid receptors) and *Dextro-naltrexone* (which reduces inflammation). Because the *Levo* component blocks natural endorphins, the dose cannot be raised high enough to fully suppress inflammation without causing severe side effects (like pain sensitivity or depression). Dr. Younger aims to isolate the *Dextro* component to create a drug that targets inflammation exclusively, allowing for much higher, more effective dosing.

## How was it researched?

This is an ongoing translational research project. Dr. Younger has identified that D-Naltrexone acts as a **Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist**. TLR4 is the primary "switch" that activates microglia (brain immune cells). Since pharmaceutical companies have declined to develop this drug due to low profit potential (it is an unpatentable natural isomer), Dr. Younger's lab has taken on the role of the manufacturer. They are currently raising funds to synthesize the pure drug, filing an **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application with the FDA, and designing the first human clinical trials to test its safety and efficacy.

## What has been found?

- **The Glia Theory:** Dr. Younger explains that in ME/CFS, the brain's immune cells (**microglia**) are "primed" or stuck in a hyperactive state. Instead of protecting the brain, they constantly release inflammatory chemicals (cytokines) that cause "sickness behavior"—the feeling of severe fatigue, brain fog, and widespread pain.
  - **The Dextro-Naltrexone Solution:** In pre-clinical models, D-Naltrexone successfully shuts down this microglial activation by blocking TLR4 receptors. Unlike regular naltrexone, it has **zero interaction with opioid receptors**. This means it does not block pain-relieving endorphins, theoretically allowing patients to take doses 10x to 20x higher than LDN to aggressively crush brain inflammation without side effects.

## Discussion

Dr. Younger highlights a major systemic failure in drug development known as the "Valley of Death," where promising treatments for chronic illnesses fail to reach patients because they are not profitable for Big Pharma. Because D-Naltrexone is an isomer of an old drug, it cannot be easily patented. Consequently, no drug company will invest the millions needed for clinical trials. Dr. Younger argues that academic labs must step in to bridge this gap. He also notes that while LDN is a helpful tool, it is likely only scratching the surface of what naltrexone can do; the "dextro" side is doing the healing, while the "levo" side is limiting the dose.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Dr. Younger concludes that Dextro-Naltrexone represents one of the most promising targeted therapies for neuroinflammation-driven fatigue and pain. His lab is currently finalizing the manufacturing protocol and preparing for the regulatory hurdles of the FDA. The immediate next step is securing sufficient funding (via donations and grants) to pay for the synthesis of the clinical-grade drug and the subsequent human safety trials.
