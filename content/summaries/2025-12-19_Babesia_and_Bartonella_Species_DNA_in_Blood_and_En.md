## Summary

This research reveals a high prevalence of vector-borne infections in a subset of ME/CFS patients, suggesting that specialized testing for Bartonella and Babesia is clinically relevant for those with neurological symptoms. The findings indicate that nearly half of the participants carried these difficult-to-detect pathogens. This provides a foundation for investigating whether targeted antimicrobial treatments could offer symptom relief for a significant portion of this patient population.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the prevalence of Babesia and Bartonella species DNA in individuals suffering from chronic fatigue and concurrent neurological symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers sought to determine if persistent infections with these vector-borne "stealth" pathogens could be linked to the complex symptoms of ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

Blood and enrichment cultures from 50 participants with fatigue lasting six months to 19 years were analyzed using highly sensitive qPCR and DNA sequencing.

## What has been found?

Infection was confirmed in 46% of participants, with Babesia species detected in 24% and Bartonella species in 26% of the cohort. Specific identified pathogens included Bartonella henselae, Babesia odocoilei, and Babesia divergens-like MO-1.

## Discussion

Limitations of the study include a small sample size and the lack of a healthy control group, which prevents the establishment of a causal relationship.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The results suggest these pathogens may be significant cofactors in ME/CFS, warranting larger case-control studies using sensitive detection methods.
