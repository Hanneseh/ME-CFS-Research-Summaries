## Summary

This study demonstrates that high-dose probiotic therapy can significantly alleviate fatigue in ME/CFS patients by addressing gut-related metabolic imbalances. By showing a clear link between improved gut health and reduced neurotoxic metabolites, the research provides a biological rationale for targeting the microbiome in ME/CFS treatment. These findings offer a potential therapeutic pathway for patients suffering from both chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal issues.

## What was researched?

This pilot study investigated the effects of a high-concentration multi-strain probiotic 💊 on fatigue severity and the "gut-kynurenine axis" in ME/CFS patients with co-occurring irritable bowel syndrome.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers aimed to explore whether gut dysbiosis in ME/CFS drives symptoms by shifting tryptophan metabolism toward neurotoxic pathways. They sought to determine if correcting this bacterial imbalance could restore metabolic health and reduce patient fatigue.

## How was it researched?

Forty female patients with ME/CFS and confirmed gut dysbiosis received the CDS22 probiotic formula daily for 12 weeks. The study monitored changes in fatigue scores and analyzed urinary tryptophan metabolites and gut health markers compared to 40 healthy controls.

## What has been found?

The intervention led to a 40.3% reduction in fatigue scores, with 97.5% of patients reaching the clinical remission threshold. Biochemically, the probiotic increased the neuroprotective kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid ratio by 45% and decreased markers of harmful bacterial activity. Tryptophan levels also normalized toward those seen in healthy individuals.

## Discussion

While the results are promising, the study's open-label design and female-only cohort mean that findings should be interpreted with caution. The study effectively highlights the kynurenine pathway as a significant link between gut health and ME/CFS symptoms.

## Conclusion & Future Work

High-dose probiotics appear to be a safe and effective way to modulate tryptophan metabolism and improve clinical status in ME/CFS patients with gut issues. Further randomized, double-blind trials are necessary to validate these metabolic and clinical improvements.
