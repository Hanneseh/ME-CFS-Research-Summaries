## Summary

This paper announces a major, well-designed German clinical trial (RAPID) to test treatments for Post Covid Syndrome, a condition with significant symptom overlap with ME/CFS. The first phase of the trial will test an antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug called vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) to see if it can improve physical function. This drug was chosen because it targets the widely held theory that persistent viral activity and chronic inflammation drive the illness. The trial's innovative "adaptive platform" design allows researchers to test multiple drugs more efficiently and is a significant step forward in the search for the first proven, effective treatments for post-viral diseases like PCS and potentially ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This paper describes the study protocol for RAPID, a large-scale, multicenter adaptive platform trial in Germany designed to evaluate various treatment options for Post Covid Syndrome (PCS). It specifically details the first intervention arm, called RAPID_REVIVE, which will assess the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) 💊 in improving physical function for patients with PCS.

## Why was it researched?

A significant portion of individuals who contract COVID-19 develop long-term symptoms known as PCS, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatment options available. The RAPID trial was established to address this urgent medical need by creating an efficient framework to test promising therapies. The first drug, vidofludimus calcium, was selected because it targets two leading hypotheses for the cause of PCS: persistent SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoirs or reactivation of other viruses like EBV, and the resulting chronic inflammation.

## How was it researched?

This document is a study protocol, outlining the methodology of a future clinical trial. RAPID_REVIVE is designed as a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to enroll 376 adults with moderate to severe PCS across 11 hospitals in Germany. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a daily oral dose of vidofludimus calcium or a placebo for a 56-day treatment period, followed by a 28-day follow-up. The primary outcome will be the change in physical function from baseline to day 56, as measured by the Short Form-36 Physical Function (SF-36-PF) questionnaire, with secondary endpoints assessing fatigue, cognitive symptoms, and other quality of life metrics.

## What has been found?

As this is a study protocol, it describes the plan for the research rather than its results. No findings have been generated yet. The trial was registered in March 2024, and the protocol indicates that patient recruitment was planned to begin in August 2024 and be completed by June 2025.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the significant advantages of the adaptive platform trial design. This modern approach is more efficient and flexible than traditional single-drug trials, allowing researchers to evaluate multiple interventions simultaneously, add new treatment arms as they emerge, and adapt the study based on incoming data. This is particularly valuable for a new and complex illness like PCS, where the scientific understanding is evolving rapidly and numerous treatment hypotheses need to be tested.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the RAPID platform trial is a crucial step toward establishing an evidence base for treating PCS, which currently does not exist. The first arm, RAPID_REVIVE, will investigate a promising antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, addressing core hypotheses of the disease's pathology. In the future, the overarching RAPID platform is designed to incorporate and evaluate additional interventions, aiming to accelerate the identification of effective treatments for this debilitating condition.
