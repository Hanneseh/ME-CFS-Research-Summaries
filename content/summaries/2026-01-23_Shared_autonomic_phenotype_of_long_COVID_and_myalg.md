## Summary

This research provides high-quality evidence that Long COVID and ME/CFS are physiologically almost indistinguishable in terms of how they affect the autonomic nervous system and brain blood flow. By quantifying these impairments, the study validates the physical nature of these often 'invisible' illnesses and identifies preload failure as a critical common factor. These results support the clinical perspective that Long COVID and ME/CFS are part of the same disease spectrum. Such findings are vital for streamlining diagnosis and ensuring that future clinical trials address the core physiological commonalities of both conditions.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the clinical and physiological similarities in autonomic function between patients with Long COVID and those with ME/CFS. Researchers specifically analyzed shared objective markers related to blood flow and nervous system dysfunction.

## Why was it researched?

Both Long COVID and ME/CFS share symptoms like fatigue and brain fog, yet the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. The study aimed to determine if these conditions share a common 'phenotype' that can be quantified through specialized medical testing.

## How was it researched?

This retrospective study compared 143 Long COVID patients and 170 ME/CFS patients against healthy controls and patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). Evaluations included tilt-table tests, transcranial Doppler for brain blood flow, skin biopsies for nerve density, and invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

## What has been found?

The study found extensive similarities, including reduced brain blood flow in roughly 90% of both patient groups and widespread autonomic failure in over 89%. Small fiber neuropathy was detected in a majority of participants, and preload failure—a cardiac filling issue during exercise—was present in over 92% of cases. Laboratory blood tests, however, failed to distinguish between the two conditions, highlighting the need for functional testing.

## Discussion

The findings suggest that the clinical overlap between Long COVID and ME/CFS is mirrored by near-identical physiological impairments in blood flow and nerve function. A limitation noted was that while hEDS patients shared some symptoms, they exhibited more severe peripheral nerve degeneration, suggesting hEDS may involve a distinct primary pathway.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Long COVID and ME/CFS demonstrate a shared autonomic phenotype characterized by impaired cerebrovascular blood flow and small fiber neuropathy. This indicates they may share a common underlying pathophysiology and could benefit from similar diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
