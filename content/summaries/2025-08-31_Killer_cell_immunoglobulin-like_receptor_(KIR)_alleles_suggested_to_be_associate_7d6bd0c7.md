## Summary

This study provides new genetic evidence supporting the theory of immune dysregulation in ME/CFS. It suggests that specific, inherited variations in genes that regulate Natural Killer (NK) cell function may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to the disease. While not a diagnostic tool, this research pinpoints specific immune pathways that may be dysfunctional in patients. These findings could help guide future research into the biological mechanisms of ME/CFS and potentially identify targets for future treatments, but first, they must be validated in larger international studies.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether specific genetic variations, known as alleles, in the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes are associated with ME/CFS. KIRs are receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells that help regulate their function.

## Why was it researched?

Previous research has pointed to immune system dysfunction in ME/CFS, particularly abnormal function of NK cells. However, smaller, earlier studies on KIR genes in ME/CFS patients produced conflicting results. This larger, high-resolution study was needed to clarify whether genetic variations in these immune-regulating genes are linked to the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a genetic association study that analyzed DNA samples from 418 Norwegian ME/CFS patients and 473 healthy controls. The researchers used high-resolution next-generation sequencing to identify the specific alleles of KIR genes present in each participant. They also included Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) data to assess the interaction between KIR receptors and their corresponding ligands.

## What has been found?

The study found no significant association between ME/CFS and the overall presence or number of copies of KIR genes. However, the data suggested an association with specific alleles of genes that code for *inhibitory* KIRs. Three alleles (KIR3DL3*002, KIR3DL1*020, and KIR3DL2*009) were significantly more frequent in patients, while two alleles (KIR3DL3*013 and KIR3DL2*010) were significantly less frequent.

## Discussion

The authors note that this is the largest KIR genetic study in ME/CFS to date. They acknowledge that their findings require replication in even larger cohorts to be confirmed, as only one of the allele associations would remain statistically significant after applying a very strict correction for multiple comparisons. The findings do, however, align with the theory of NK cell dysfunction in ME/CFS, as the associated alleles are all on genes for inhibitory receptors which directly control NK cell activity.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that their data suggest certain alleles of inhibitory KIR genes are associated with ME/CFS, supporting the involvement of NK cells in the disease's development. They state that these findings warrant replication in larger patient cohorts to establish robust genetic associations.
