## Summary

This conference report indicates that research is making significant progress in identifying the biological causes of ME/CFS. Several distinct problems are being targeted, including autoimmunity (rogue antibodies), cellular energy problems (Warburg effect), and ion channel dysfunction. This is leading to multiple new clinical trials for existing drugs like daratumumab, low-dose naltrexone, and even the supplement oxaloacetate, which have shown positive initial results. This suggests a shift away from one-size-fits-all treatments and toward a future where patients might receive therapies targeted at their specific biological subgroup.

## What was researched?

This news article reports on the IACFS/ME 2025 conference, summarizing multiple research presentations. The focus was on new findings regarding the underlying pathomechanisms of ME/CFS and long COVID, and the potential treatment approaches that target these identified abnormalities.

## Why was it researched?

The article aims to synthesize emerging research to provide an update on the field. A better understanding of the pathophysiology—including neuroinflammation, immune dysfunction, and metabolic issues—is necessary to move beyond supportive care and develop targeted treatments for the complex, multisystem nature of ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This article is a piece of conference journalism. The author summarized keynote presentations and interviews with several prominent researchers, including Dr. Luis Nacul, Dr. Carmen Scheibenbogen, Dr. Øystein Fluge, Dr. Sonya Gradisnik-Marshall, and Dr. Suzanne D. Vernon. It reports on the designs and initial findings of their respective recent and ongoing studies.

## What has been found?

The conference highlighted several key research areas. Drs. Scheibenbogen and Fluge presented evidence for autoimmunity in a subset of patients, with ongoing trials for antibody-targeting drugs like daratumumab 💊 and a new trial for rituximab 💊. Dr. Gradisnik-Marshall's work showed that low-dose naltrexone 💊 may restore function to dysfunctional TRPM3 ion channels in long COVID. Dr. Vernon's studies suggested that oxaloacetate 💊 can reduce fatigue by addressing metabolic dysfunction related to the "Warburg Effect."

## Discussion

The speakers, including Dr. Nacul, emphasized that ME/CFS is a heterogeneous disease and that a "magic pill" is unlikely. They suggest that combination therapies, or different treatments for different patient subgroups (like those with autoimmune markers), will be necessary. Dr. Fluge noted that while pharmaceutical interest has been low, the accumulating objective data is likely to change that.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The article concludes that research is increasingly identifying specific, targetable abnormalities in ME/CFS and long COVID. Ongoing clinical trials for various immunomodulating and metabolic drugs (daratumumab, rituximab, low-dose naltrexone, oxaloacetate) represent promising new avenues for treatment based on these pathogenic mechanisms.
