## Summary

This theoretical review paper proposes a compelling new explanation for the complex, multi-system nature of ME/CFS. It suggests that tiny particles called exosomes transport regulatory molecules (LncRNAs) between cells throughout the body, potentially spreading dysfunction and causing the hallmark symptoms of the illness, such as immune abnormalities and energy failure. By identifying specific LncRNAs involved in these processes, this work lays the groundwork for developing the first objective, molecular biomarkers for ME/CFS, which could lead to definitive diagnostic tests. While still a hypothesis, this provides a unified theory that connects many disparate findings in ME/CFS research.

## What was researched?

This paper reviews the potential association between long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) carried within exosomes (tiny vesicles that travel between cells) and the development of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The authors explore the scientific hypothesis that these exosomal LncRNAs (EV-LncRNAs) could serve as a molecular link between the various system-wide abnormalities seen in CFS and act as potential biomarkers for diagnosis.

## Why was it researched?

The underlying cause (pathogenesis) of CFS is unknown, and there are currently no effective treatments or specific diagnostic biomarkers. Researchers hypothesized that EV-LncRNAs, which are known to regulate gene expression and mediate communication between cells, might be involved in the multi-system dysfunction characteristic of CFS, including immune, neuroendocrine, and metabolic problems.

## How was it researched?

This study is a systematic literature review. The authors did not conduct new experiments but instead synthesized existing research from immunology, molecular biology, and neurology to build a theoretical framework. They analyzed the known functions of various LncRNAs and connected them to the established pathological features of CFS, such as immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the effects of viral infections.

## What has been found?

The review proposes several specific mechanisms by which LncRNAs could contribute to CFS pathology. For instance, dysregulation of certain LncRNAs (e.g., `linc-MAF-4`, `GATA3-AS1`) could explain the T-cell imbalances and chronic inflammation, while others (e.g., `glycoLINC`, `H19`, `ROSALIND`) could be responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism deficits seen in patients. The authors highlight a previous study that found significantly increased levels of three immune-related LncRNAs in the blood cells of CFS patients, supporting their potential as disease biomarkers.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation of their work is the scarcity of studies directly investigating LncRNAs in CFS. The connections proposed are largely hypothetical and based on indirect evidence from research in other diseases. Therefore, a direct causal relationship has not been established and requires future experimental validation to overcome potential biases from existing datasets.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that EV-LncRNAs represent a promising and previously unexplored area of CFS research, potentially serving as the molecular messengers that link the disease's diverse pathologies. They strongly advocate for future research to focus on validating these molecules as clinical biomarkers. They recommend large-scale, multicenter studies using advanced methods like single-cell sequencing to confirm their hypotheses and better understand the role of EV-LncRNAs in CFS.
