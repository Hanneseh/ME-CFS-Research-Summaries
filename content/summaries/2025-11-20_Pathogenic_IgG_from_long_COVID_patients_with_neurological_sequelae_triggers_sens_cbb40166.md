## Summary

This research provides crucial evidence that some Long COVID symptoms, particularly chronic pain and sensory sensitivity, have a direct autoimmune cause. By showing that antibodies from patients can "transfer" these symptoms to mice, the study moves beyond observation and suggests that the immune system is actively attacking parts of the nervous system. While the study did not find a direct link to cognitive "brain fog" in this specific animal model, the discovery that antibodies settle in the sensory nerve clusters (dorsal root ganglia) offers a clear physical target for future diagnostics. This supports the growing scientific consensus that Long COVID involves measurable biological dysfunction in the immune-nervous system interface, similar to findings in ME/CFS and fibromyalgia.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from Long COVID patients with neurological symptoms (such as brain fog, pain, and fatigue) could cause similar symptoms in healthy mice. The researchers specifically focused on whether these antibodies bind to the nervous system and trigger sensory, cognitive, or psychiatric impairments.

## Why was it researched?

Approximately 30% of Long COVID patients experience persistent neurological issues, but the exact cause remains unknown. A leading hypothesis is that these symptoms are driven by an autoimmune response involving autoantibodies that attack the nervous system. This research sought to prove a causal link by determining if transferring purified antibodies from patients into animals would replicate the disease manifestations.

## How was it researched?

This was a passive transfer laboratory study using a cohort of 90 Long COVID patients (defined by WHO criteria) and age/sex-matched healthy controls. Researchers purified IgG antibodies from the participants' blood and injected them into C57Bl/6J mice for four consecutive days. The mice were then subjected to a battery of behavioral tests over two weeks to assess pain sensitivity, spatial memory, anxiety, and depression. The team also used fluorescent imaging and tissue analysis to track where the human antibodies settled within the mice's nervous systems.

## What has been found?

The study found that mice receiving Long COVID IgG developed a significant but temporary increase in mechanical pain sensitivity (allodynia) during the first week. This effect was specifically tied to the antibodies, as it was abolished when the IgG was removed from the serum or broken down with the enzyme papain 💊. Interestingly, the mice did not display impairments in memory, anxiety, or depression behaviors. Anatomical analysis revealed that the Long COVID antibodies accumulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia and attached directly to sensory neurons, although no signs of neuroinflammation were detected in the brain.

## Discussion

The authors note that while the study successfully replicated sensory pain, it failed to trigger cognitive "brain fog" or psychiatric symptoms in the mice. They suggest this might be due to the short duration of the experiment, a potential requirement for higher antibody doses, or the difficulty of modeling complex human cognitive symptoms in a mouse model. The researchers emphasize that the binding of IgG to peripheral sensory nerves strongly supports the concept of "autoimmune pain" in the Long COVID spectrum.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that IgG autoantibodies from Long COVID patients are pathogenic and directly contribute to sensory symptoms by targeting peripheral sensory neurons. They suggest that future research should focus on identifying the specific self-antigens (proteins) these antibodies target and investigating alternative mechanisms that might explain cognitive symptoms. This work highlights the potential for antibody-targeted therapies, such as plasma exchange or specific immune modulators, in treating neurological Long COVID.
