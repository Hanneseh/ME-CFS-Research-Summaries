## Summary

This study identifies amifampridine as a potential breakthrough treatment for the profound fatigue and hypersomnia associated with Post-COVID Syndrome. By significantly reducing sleep needs and improving functional scores in a small patient group, it suggests a common physiological pathway between Long COVID fatigue and neuromuscular disorders. These findings offer a specific pharmacological target for a condition that currently lacks established evidence-based therapies.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the efficacy of the potassium channel blocker amifampridine 💊 in treating severe fatigue and excessive sleep requirements in patients suffering from Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS).

## Why was it researched?

With millions of people affected by PCS-associated fatigue and no established treatment options available, the researcher sought to explore the potential of amifampridine after observing significant symptom relief in a patient with a co-occurring neuromuscular condition.

## How was it researched?

The researcher conducted a collective casuistry involving five patients with moderate to severe PCS, including one self-observation. The methodology included long-term monitoring of Bell scores and daily sleep duration, supplemented by a double-blind discontinuation trial in two patients to control for placebo effects.

## What has been found?

All five patients experienced a significant increase in functional Bell scores and a normalization of sleep duration, with mean scores rising from 28 to 82. The double-blind discontinuation trials confirmed that fatigue symptoms returned when the medication was replaced with a placebo and improved again upon resuming treatment.

## Discussion

The study is limited by its very small sample size and its nature as a case series rather than a large-scale trial. However, the use of double-blind discontinuation periods strengthens the evidence that the observed improvements were directly caused by the medication.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Amifampridine shows strong preliminary evidence for reducing PCS-associated fatigue and hypersomnia. The author calls for urgent randomized double-blind studies to confirm these findings and expand the drug's indication to include Long COVID patients.
