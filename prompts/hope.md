I want to write a Reddit post with the title: If you are losing hope, read this.

The post should paint a science-based, hopeful picture about what is reasonable to expect in the next 1 to 3 years from ME/CFS research and finding effective therapeutics or even cures.

The post should start with a short introduction of what the post is (and state that it is AI-written based on this repo: [https://github.com/Hanneseh/ME-CFS-Research-Summaries](https://github.com/Hanneseh/ME-CFS-Research-Summaries)) and what the intention is.

Then, it should elaborate on the number of recently published studies by major institutions and the valuable insights gained from recently published papers. The post should explain to a non-medical Reddit audience, who are caregivers and ME/CFS patients, what the current stage of disease understanding, biomarker identification, and therapeutic findings is. From this, the final section should extrapolate and paint a picture of what is reasonable to expect in the next 1 to 3 years and how severe ME/CFS patients who are currently in bed have a science-supported reason to hope for getting help within this time frame.

Important: To increase the trustworthiness of the post, the studies mentioned should be cited by placing links (DOI) directly in the text. The link text should just be the author and date in APA style. Reddit supports Markdown, so make use of that for the link embedding and text formatting.

The post can be on the longer side; I am thinking 7k to 10k tokens. It should leave the reader with the sense of knowing a lot has happened and a lot is going on right now, so we can expect discoveries to be made soon.

Below is the research body on which to base the post and from where to pick the links and lead author names for citing the research.

Can you write the post for me?
