- **What was researched?**
This Phase II controlled trial investigated if Heart Rate Variability-Biofeedback (HRV-BF), a non-pharmacological intervention, is a feasible and potentially effective therapy for individuals with Long COVID who meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The study's primary goals were to assess feasibility through dropout rates and patient satisfaction, and to measure preliminary changes in symptoms like fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain.
- **Why was it researched?**
The symptoms of Long COVID frequently overlap with those of ME/CFS, a condition for which there are no proven effective treatments. This has created an urgent need for new, safe, and integrative management strategies. Researchers hypothesized that HRV-BF, a technique aimed at improving self-regulation of the nervous system, could be a practical and acceptable intervention to help manage the complex symptom burden in this patient population.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a small, controlled feasibility study involving 18 participants with Long COVID and ME/CFS. The participants were assigned to one of two groups: an intervention group that received 10 sessions of HRV-BF over five weeks in addition to their usual medical care, or a control group that only received usual care. The HRV-BF sessions involved using real-time feedback on heart rate to learn controlled breathing patterns. Researchers used standardized questionnaires to measure fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life before and after the intervention period.
- **What has been found?**
The study demonstrated that HRV-BF is a highly feasible and well-tolerated intervention, with a very low dropout rate (5.56%) and high participant satisfaction. The main finding was a statistically significant improvement in severe fatigue in the HRV-BF group compared to the control group. While improvements in other individual symptoms like anxiety, depression, and pain were not statistically significant, an overall trend of positive changes was observed across all measures in the group that received the intervention.
- **Discussion:**
The authors emphasize that as a small, preliminary Phase II study, the findings are not definitive proof of clinical efficacy and should be interpreted with caution. The study's main limitation is its small sample size, which increases the possibility of the results being due to chance. However, a key strength highlighted is the excellent feasibility of the intervention, demonstrated by an exceptionally low dropout rate compared to other non-pharmacological therapies studied in ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that HRV-BF is a feasible, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for people with ME/CFS following Long COVID. The promising preliminary results, particularly for reducing fatigue, strongly support the need for larger, more definitive Phase III clinical trials. Future research should aim to confirm these benefits and investigate the intervention's potential effects on the broader spectrum of ME/CFS and Long COVID symptoms.
- **Summary:**
This research explores a non-drug, self-regulation technique called HRV-Biofeedback as a potential management tool for ME/CFS symptoms that arise after a COVID-19 infection. The study's most important finding is a significant reduction in severe fatigue, a core symptom of the illness, which is noteworthy given the lack of proven treatments. Critically, the intervention proved to be very practical and acceptable to patients, with almost no one dropping out, in stark contrast to more controversial interventions previously studied. While this is an early-stage study that does not provide a definitive treatment, it offers strong justification for larger trials and presents a potential new direction for a safe, empowering symptom management tool.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a mind-body technique using breathing and heart rate feedback to help people with ME/CFS after Long COVID. The study found the technique was safe and practical, and it significantly reduced severe fatigue in the small group of patients who used it. These positive early results mean larger studies are now justified to confirm if this could become a helpful tool for managing symptoms.
