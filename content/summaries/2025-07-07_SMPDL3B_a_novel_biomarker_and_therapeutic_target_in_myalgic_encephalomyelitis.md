## Summary

This research identifies a specific molecular abnormality in the immune cells of ME/CFS patients that directly correlates with disease severity. It suggests that a key regulatory protein (SMPDL3B) is being improperly cut from the surface of immune cells, leading to increased inflammation. This provides a potential biological explanation for some of the immune dysregulation in the illness and offers a quantifiable biomarker. Most significantly, the study showed in a lab setting that two existing drugs can reverse this process, presenting a clear and targeted new avenue for the development of future treatments that must now be tested in human trials.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the role of a specific immune-regulatory protein, Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B), in ME/CFS. Researchers aimed to determine if levels of this protein could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and if modulating it could represent a new therapeutic strategy.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating illness with no objective diagnostic tests or targeted treatments, partly due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying biology. Since immune dysfunction is a known hallmark of the disease, the researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of SMPDL3B, a protein involved in regulating innate immune responses, might contribute to the chronic inflammation and impaired antiviral defenses seen in patients.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study that analyzed blood samples from two separate groups: a Canadian cohort of 249 ME patients and 63 healthy controls, and a Norwegian replication cohort of 141 ME patients. The researchers used ELISA and flow cytometry to measure the levels of SMPDL3B in the plasma (soluble form) and on the surface of immune cells (membrane-bound form). They also performed *in vitro* experiments on immune cells (PBMCs) to see if existing drugs could correct any abnormalities found.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients had significantly elevated levels of soluble SMPDL3B in their plasma, and these higher levels correlated with greater symptom severity. In contrast, the amount of SMPDL3B attached to the surface of their immune cells (monocytes) was significantly reduced. This appears to be caused by increased activity of an enzyme called PI-PLC, which cleaves SMPDL3B from the cell membrane. In laboratory experiments, two existing drugs, vildagliptin 💊 and saxagliptin 💊, successfully restored the membrane-bound SMPDL3B and reduced the soluble form by inhibiting PI-PLC activity.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the loss of membrane-bound SMPDL3B, which normally helps to dampen inflammatory signaling (via TLR4), could contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in ME/CFS. This imbalance could also explain previously observed abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The primary limitations noted were the cross-sectional study design, which cannot prove causation, and a significant female predominance in the patient cohorts, which limited robust analysis of sex-specific differences.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that SMPDL3B is a promising biomarker for ME/CFS severity and a potential therapeutic target. The *in vitro* success of vildagliptin and saxagliptin in preserving membrane-bound SMPDL3B suggests a novel treatment strategy for restoring immune balance. The study calls for future clinical trials to evaluate the potential of these drugs to mitigate immune dysfunction and reduce symptoms in ME/CFS patients.
