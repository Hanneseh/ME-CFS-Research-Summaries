## Summary

This large-scale review provides a ranked comparison of non-drug treatments for depression in ME/CFS, a major comorbidity of the disease. The findings suggest that interventions like a specific diet (polyphenol-rich chocolate) and traditional therapies like moxibustion may be more effective than exercise or psychotherapy for these specific symptoms. While the evidence for the top-ranked diet therapy is still preliminary and requires more robust research, this analysis offers a valuable evidence-based starting point for patients and clinicians exploring alternatives to antidepressants for managing depression in ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various non-pharmacological therapies for alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The researchers used a network meta-analysis to rank the different treatments against each other.

## Why was it researched?

Depression is a common and burdensome symptom in CFS, but standard drug treatments are often controversial and have significant side effects. While many non-drug therapies exist, their relative effectiveness was unclear, and there was a lack of high-quality evidence comparing them directly. This study was conducted to fill this research gap and provide evidence-based guidance for clinical decisions.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 47 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 4,028 patients. The researchers searched nine scientific databases for studies that investigated non-drug interventions such as diet therapy, acupuncture, moxibustion, psychotherapy, and various forms of exercise. Using a Bayesian statistical model, they integrated direct and indirect evidence from these trials to compare the efficacy of all treatments simultaneously.

## What has been found?

The analysis revealed that, compared to control measures, diet therapy 💊 (specifically polyphenol-rich chocolate) was the most effective intervention for improving depressive symptoms in CFS patients. This was followed by moxibustion (Mox) 💊, a form of traditional heat therapy, and combination therapies involving acupuncture and moxibustion. In contrast, four types of exercise therapy (aerobics, resistance training, relaxation therapy, Qigong) and psychotherapy did not show a statistically significant effect on improving depression scores in this analysis.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations. The included studies used different scales to measure depression, which could introduce variability. Most of the 47 studies were rated as having a medium risk of bias, and some interventions, including the top-ranked diet therapy, were supported by only a few studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, the authors advise that the results, particularly the strong effect of diet therapy, should be interpreted with caution.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that several non-pharmacological therapies, particularly diet therapy and moxibustion, appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in CFS patients. They strongly recommend that more high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and strengthen the evidence base for these promising non-drug treatments.
