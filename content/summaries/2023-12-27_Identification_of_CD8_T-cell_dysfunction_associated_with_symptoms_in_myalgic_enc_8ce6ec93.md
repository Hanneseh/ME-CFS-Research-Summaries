## Summary

This study provides evidence for a specific, measurable dysfunction in the immune systems of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, where key "killer" T-cells (CD8 T-cells) appear exhausted and are unable to function properly. This finding could lead to the development of a standardized, objective blood test to aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, the paper presents preliminary but encouraging results from a small group of patients who used a novel nebulized treatment and experienced significant symptom reduction alongside a partial reversal of this immune dysfunction. While not a cure, this research opens a new avenue for therapies that target immune modulation and oxidative stress, though these findings must be validated in larger clinical trials.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the function of a specific type of immune cell, the CD8 T-cell, in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID compared to healthy individuals. It also retrospectively analyzed whether a nebulized treatment with antioxidant and anti-pathogen properties could improve both this immune cell dysfunction and patient-reported symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS and Long COVID share many symptoms and are often triggered by infections, suggesting they may have a common underlying pathology involving a dysregulated immune system. Researchers hypothesized that an aberrant immune response leads to CD8 T-cell dysfunction, similar to the "T-cell exhaustion" seen in chronic viral infections. This study aimed to identify a specific biomarker for these conditions and explore a potential multi-mechanism treatment targeting oxidative stress and immune dysregulation.

## How was it researched?

The study involved two parts. First, a laboratory analysis was conducted on fresh blood samples from 12 ME/CFS patients, 8 Long COVID patients, and 10 healthy controls to measure CD8 T-cell function via intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Second, it presented a retrospective case series of 8 of these patients (4 ME/CFS, 4 Long COVID) who independently chose to use a nebulized treatment, Inspiritol, for a period of 3-15 months. Researchers reviewed changes in their T-cell function and symptom severity scores over the course of the treatment.

## What has been found?

The study found that CD8 T-cells from both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients had a significantly diminished capacity to produce the cytokines IFNy and TNFa after stimulation compared to healthy controls, confirming a state of immune dysfunction. In the retrospective case series of 8 patients treated with a nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen agent (Inspiritol) 💊, there was an observed improvement in this CD8 T-cell function that occurred in parallel with symptom improvement. On average, these patients reported a 54% decrease in overall symptom severity, and no serious treatment-associated side effects were noted.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the observed CD8 T-cell dysfunction is a fundamental aspect of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, potentially explaining the body's inability to control latent pathogens. They note that the multi-component nature of the nebulized agent, which has antioxidant, anti-pathogen, and immunomodulatory properties, may address several underlying mechanisms of the diseases simultaneously. The primary limitation is the small number of patients in the retrospective, uncontrolled case series, which means the results are preliminary.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that CD8 T-cell dysfunction appears to be a key feature of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, and that this measurement has potential as a diagnostic and treatment-tracking biomarker. The positive results from the retrospective case series, although preliminary, support advancing the nebulized agent into larger, controlled clinical trials to formally evaluate its safety and efficacy for both conditions.
