## Overview

- **Trial ID:** NCT05697640

    - **Sponsor / Lead:** Charité University, Berlin, Germany
    - **Location(s):** Berlin, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 2
    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-06-22
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31

## Purpose of the Trial

This trial aims to see if an approved drug called Vericiguat 💊 can relieve profound fatigue and other symptoms in people with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), including those who meet the criteria for ME/CFS. The study is based on the theory that impaired blood flow in small blood vessels contributes to PCS symptoms. Vericiguat is believed to improve this blood flow, which may lead to a reduction in symptoms like fatigue and an improvement in physical function.

## Trial Design & Procedure

- **Duration:** Approximately 18 weeks.
    - **Design:** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants are randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants nor the investigators know who is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo (a substance with no active ingredient).
    - **Groups:** Participants will be split into two groups. One group will receive Vericiguat, and the other group will receive a matching placebo.
    - **Procedure:** The treatment involves taking one oral tablet daily for 10 weeks. The dose will be gradually increased over the first four weeks. After the 10-week treatment period, there will be a 30-day follow-up period.
