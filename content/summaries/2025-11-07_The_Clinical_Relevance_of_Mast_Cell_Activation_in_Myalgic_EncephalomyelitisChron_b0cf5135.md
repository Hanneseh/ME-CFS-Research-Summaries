## Summary

This study provides strong evidence that a significant subgroup of ME/CFS patients, estimated at up to 25%, has clinically relevant mast cell activation (MCA). The research establishes a clear association between this MCA involvement and a higher prevalence of orthostatic intolerance (OI), particularly POTS. This is a crucial finding for patients, as it suggests that identifying MCA is key to personalizing treatment. The study showed that ME/CFS patients with both MCA and OI reported significant symptom improvement from mast cell-targeted therapies, offering a potential treatment pathway for this subgroup. This research underscores the importance of screening for MCA to better manage OI symptoms and improve outcomes for this patient cohort.

## What was researched?

This study investigated how common mast cell activation (MCA) is in an Austrian cohort of ME/CFS patients. It also explored the clinical relevance of MCA and its relationship with orthostatic intolerance (OI), particularly postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

## Why was it researched?

Growing evidence suggests that mast cell activation (MCA) may contribute to ME/CFS symptoms , and researchers have noted an overlap in symptoms like orthostatic intolerance (OI) and POTS between ME/CFS and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). However, the extent to which MCA plays a role in the pathophysiology of OI within the ME/CFS population was still unknown. This research aimed to stratify patients to help identify subgroups and improve personalized treatment options.

## How was it researched?

The researchers analyzed two data sets. The first was a large online questionnaire (CCCFS cohort) with 687 self-reporting ME/CFS patients from German-speaking regions. The second was a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 383 Austrian ME/CFS patients (ME/CFS-MCA cohort) from a specialized neurology practice. The data was analyzed to compare the prevalence of OI and treatment responses in patients with and without diagnosed or suspected mast cell activation.

## What has been found?

The study found that MCA is a frequent comorbidity, with its prevalence increasing over the course of the disease; up to 25.3% of patients in one cohort met the criteria for clinically relevant MCA. In both patient cohorts, orthostatic intolerance (OI), and specifically POTS, was significantly more common in ME/CFS patients who also had MCA involvement. Patients with both MCAS and OI reported significant symptom improvement from **mast cell-targeted treatment** 💊 ($p<0.0001$). This subgroup also responded more frequently to **IF-channel inhibitors** 💊 ($p=0.076$), but showed no significant difference in response to beta blockers, compared to patients without MCAS.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the reliance on self-reported data in the first cohort and the retrospective (looking-back) design of the second. They also note that results from Austrian cohorts may not be fully generalizable to other populations. A key issue highlighted was the lack of laboratory testing for MCAS in most patients (only 3.1% in one cohort), even when clinically suspected, which underscores a gap in current diagnostic practices.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that mast cell activation (MCA) is a frequent and clinically relevant comorbidity in ME/CFS that is strongly associated with a higher prevalence of OI, especially POTS. They suggest that stratifying ME/CFS patients based on MCA involvement is essential for tailoring personalized treatment approaches. Future research should use laboratory testing to validate these findings and explore the overlapping biological pathways.
