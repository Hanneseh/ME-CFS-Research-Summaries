## Summary

This study introduces a novel blood analysis technique, called RNA liquid biopsy, that identifies distinct patterns of genetic material (cfRNA) in the blood of ME/CFS patients. The findings strongly support the theory of immune system dysregulation, revealing signals of T cell exhaustion, chronic inflammation, and altered activity in monocytes and dendritic cells. By applying machine learning to these cfRNA patterns, the researchers developed a promising, though not yet perfect, model that could distinguish patients from controls with 77% accuracy. This work represents a significant step towards a much-needed objective, blood-based diagnostic test and provides new molecular evidence reinforcing that ME/CFS is a biological illness rooted in the immune system.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are small pieces of genetic material released by cells into the bloodstream, could be used as a minimally invasive tool to diagnose ME/CFS and to better understand its underlying biology. The researchers aimed to identify cfRNA patterns specific to ME/CFS and use them to build a diagnostic model.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS lacks clinically validated biomarkers for an objective diagnosis, forcing reliance on subjective symptom evaluation. Previous research has pointed towards immune system dysregulation in the disease, but the biological mechanisms are poorly understood. The researchers explored cfRNA as a promising "liquid biopsy" tool because it can reflect dynamic changes in gene expression and cellular processes throughout the body, and has been successful in diagnosing other complex inflammatory diseases.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study that analyzed plasma samples from 93 ME/CFS patients and 75 healthy, sedentary controls. The researchers performed RNA sequencing on the cfRNA isolated from the plasma. They then used computational and machine learning methods to identify cfRNA transcripts that were different between the two groups and trained a diagnostic model to distinguish patients from controls. Additionally, they used a bioinformatic deconvolution technique to estimate the cellular origins of the cfRNA signals.

## What has been found?

The study identified 743 unique cfRNA features that differed significantly between ME/CFS cases and controls. A machine learning model (GLMNET Lasso) using a signature of 21 cfRNA genes was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with 77% accuracy and a test-set AUC of 0.81. Analysis of the cfRNA's cellular origins revealed significant differences in immune cell contributions, with ME/CFS patients showing elevated cfRNA from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and T cells, but decreased cfRNA from platelets. Pathway analysis further implicated immune dysfunction, highlighting signatures of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammatory signaling in patients.

## Discussion

The authors note that the diagnostic model's performance varied among individuals, and this variability was correlated with the amount of platelet-derived cfRNA, suggesting a true biological difference in platelet function in ME/CFS. A key limitation of the study is that it only analyzed samples taken at baseline, without provoking symptoms through an exercise challenge. The authors state that future work is needed to validate the findings in larger patient cohorts to account for disease heterogeneity and improve the model's robustness.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that cfRNA analysis is a valuable, minimally invasive tool for investigating the biology of ME/CFS, providing strong evidence for widespread immune dysregulation in the disease. They suggest that future studies should investigate cfRNA dynamics during post-exertional malaise (PEM) to gain further insight. Expanding the cohort size will be crucial for improving the generalizability and accuracy of cfRNA-based biomarkers for ME/CFS diagnosis and characterization.
