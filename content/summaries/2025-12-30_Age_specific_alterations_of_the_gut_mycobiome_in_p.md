## Summary

This study is among the first to map the gut fungal landscape (mycobiome) in ME/CFS, revealing that fungal imbalances are not only present but vary significantly depending on a patient's age. By identifying specific fungal 'signatures' for different age groups, the researchers developed high-accuracy diagnostic models, suggesting that the mycobiome could serve as a powerful tool for future objective testing and personalized treatment strategies.

## What was researched?

The study investigated whether the gut mycobiome (fungal community) is altered in patients with ME/CFS and if these changes are influenced by the patient's age.

## Why was it researched?

While bacterial imbalances in ME/CFS are well-documented, the role of gut fungi remains poorly understood despite their known impact on immune function and host health.

## How was it researched?

Researchers performed high-throughput sequencing on fecal samples from 118 individuals, including 59 ME/CFS patients and 59 healthy controls, stratified into young, middle-aged, and elderly cohorts. They used machine learning (Random Forest models) to evaluate the diagnostic potential of specific fungal taxa for each age group.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients showed significant fungal dysbiosis, but trends differed by age; fungal richness was reduced in young and middle-aged patients but unexpectedly increased in the elderly. Age-specific diagnostic models achieved near-perfect accuracy (up to 100%) in distinguishing patients from controls, identifying key discriminatory fungi such as Preussia, Aspergillus, and Chaetomium.

## Discussion

The findings suggest that failing to account for age can mask significant biological markers in ME/CFS research. The study's strengths include the age-stratified design and high predictive accuracy, though further validation in larger, more diverse global cohorts is needed.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The gut mycobiome provides distinct, age-dependent biomarkers for ME/CFS that could facilitate the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools. Future research should explore the functional role of these fungi in driving systemic inflammation and fatigue.
