## Summary

This review presents a compelling model that places skeletal muscle at the heart of ME/CFS pathophysiology. It argues that during exertion, insufficient blood flow causes a toxic buildup of calcium inside muscle cells, which damages their energy-producing mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage creates the profound energy deficit that defines post-exertional malaise. The process becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, explaining the chronic nature of the illness. This framework provides a concrete biological explanation for the disease's core symptoms and identifies clear, promising targets for future drug development aimed at improving muscle blood flow and protecting mitochondria.

## What was researched?

This review article collects and synthesizes recent scientific evidence to explain the central role of skeletal muscle abnormalities in both Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It proposes a specific biological mechanism to explain how an initial infection can lead to the chronic symptoms of ME/CFS, particularly post-exertional malaise (PEM).

## Why was it researched?

The authors previously hypothesized in 2021 that impaired blood flow (hypoperfusion) to muscles in ME/CFS patients could cause an overload of sodium and calcium within muscle cells, leading to mitochondrial damage. Since then, new experimental studies have provided strong evidence supporting this concept, necessitating an updated review to consolidate these findings and build a more complete picture of the disease's pathophysiology.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review that synthesizes findings from recent experimental research. The authors analyzed data from multiple types of studies, including muscle biopsies before and after exercise, electron microscopy to visualize cellular structures, 23-Na-MRI to measure sodium levels in muscle, and exercise tests that assess metabolic function in patients with PCS and ME/CFS.

## What has been found?

Recent studies provide direct evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and physical damage in the skeletal muscle of ME/CFS patients, particularly in the area just under the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal). This damage, which includes tissue necrosis after exercise, was not observed in non-ME/CFS Post-COVID patients. Furthermore, MRI studies have confirmed elevated sodium levels within the muscle cells of ME/CFS patients, supporting the theory that an exercise-induced ion imbalance (sodium and calcium overload) is the primary cause of the mitochondrial and muscle damage, as other potential causes like viral presence or myositis have been ruled out.

## Discussion

The authors propose that ME/CFS can be understood as an "acquired ischemic mitochondrial myopathy," a muscle disease caused by poor blood flow and mitochondrial damage. They describe a vicious cycle where an initial vascular problem (common in acute COVID-19) triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further impair blood flow, making the condition chronic and self-sustaining. Risk factors like autoantibodies and certain genetic predispositions may explain why only a subset of Post-COVID patients transition to ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a self-reproducing cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle is the central mechanism driving ME/CFS and its hallmark symptoms of exertional intolerance and PEM. They suggest that future treatments should focus on breaking this cycle by improving vascular perfusion and normalizing the ionic imbalance in muscles, rather than targeting the original infection. Promising therapeutic strategies under investigation include drugs that improve blood flow, like Mestinon 💊 and vericiguat 💊, and treatments that neutralize harmful autoantibodies.
