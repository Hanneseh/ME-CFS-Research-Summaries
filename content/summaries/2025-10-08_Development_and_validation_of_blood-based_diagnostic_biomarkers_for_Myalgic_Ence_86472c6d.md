## Summary

This research introduces a new blood test that can diagnose severe ME/CFS with very high accuracy by identifying a unique epigenetic signature in the 3D structure of DNA. The findings provide strong biological evidence of ME/CFS as a disease rooted in immune and inflammatory dysregulation. Importantly, the test was able to separate patients into distinct biological subgroups based on these immune markers, which could be a critical step toward developing personalized treatments. Because the underlying EpiSwitch® technology is already used in approved clinical tests for other diseases, this ME/CFS test has a clearer and potentially faster path to becoming a widely available diagnostic tool.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to develop and validate a blood test for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Researchers used a technology called EpiSwitch® to screen for unique 3D structures in DNA, known as chromosome conformations (CCs), that could serve as definitive diagnostic biomarkers for the disease.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating disorder that currently lacks any objective diagnostic biomarkers, which complicates and often delays diagnosis. The researchers aimed to address this critical need by applying their novel epigenetic profiling technology, which has previously been successful in identifying biomarkers for other complex diseases like cancer and ALS.

## How was it researched?

This was a retrospective case-control study that analyzed whole blood samples from 47 patients with severe (housebound) ME/CFS and 61 healthy, age-matched controls. Using a whole-genome microarray, the researchers screened for nearly one million different chromosome conformations. They then used a machine learning algorithm to identify the top 200 markers that could distinguish between patients and controls, creating a predictive model that was then tested on a separate, independent group of samples to validate its accuracy.

## What has been found?

The study successfully identified a 200-marker epigenetic signature that forms the basis of the "Episwitch® CFS test". In an independent validation cohort, this test distinguished severe ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with 92% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 96% overall accuracy. Analysis of the identified genetic markers pointed to significant dysregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways, including those involving interleukins (IL-2), TNFα, and JAK/STAT signaling. These pathways overlap with the mechanisms of action for drugs like Rituximab 💊 and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) 💊, and the data allowed for the clear clustering of patients into distinct biological subgroups.

## Discussion

The authors note that a key strength of the study is its whole-genome approach, which captures the broad, system-level epigenetic dysregulation in ME/CFS. They identify several limitations, including that the test's specificity has not yet been confirmed against other chronic inflammatory conditions like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, which show some pathway overlap. Furthermore, because the study cohort was limited to severely ill, housebound patients, the test's applicability to mild or moderate ME/CFS is still unknown and requires further investigation.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that their genome-wide epigenetic screening has identified a highly accurate blood-based biomarker signature for severe ME/CFS. The discovery of distinct patient subgroups based on IL-2-related markers suggests a potential for future precision diagnostics and targeted immunomodulatory therapies. Future work must focus on validating these findings in larger, multi-center cohorts and testing the biomarker's ability to differentiate ME/CFS from other clinically similar diseases.
