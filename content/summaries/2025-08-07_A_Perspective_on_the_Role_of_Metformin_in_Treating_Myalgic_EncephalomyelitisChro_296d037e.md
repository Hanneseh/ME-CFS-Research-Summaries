## Summary

This review provides a comprehensive biological argument for why metformin, a drug for type 2 diabetes, might be an effective treatment for ME/CFS and Long COVID. It connects the drug's known ability to improve cellular energy production, reduce oxidative stress, and calm inflammation directly to the core dysfunctions researchers have identified in patients. The paper highlights that metformin's potential is not just theoretical; a large clinical study has already shown it can significantly reduce the risk of developing Long COVID. This suggests metformin could become a valuable, evidence-based tool for treating the underlying metabolic problems in these conditions, though further trials are needed to confirm its efficacy for those already ill.

## What was researched?

This paper reviews the existing scientific evidence for using metformin 💊, a widely prescribed antidiabetic drug, as a potential treatment for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID (LC). The authors assessed how metformin's known mechanisms of action could target the underlying biological dysfunctions observed in these conditions.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS and Long COVID are debilitating post-infectious illnesses with no approved, effective treatments. There is a critical need to identify therapies that can address the core pathophysiology, which is believed to involve widespread dysfunction in cellular energy metabolism, the immune system, the gut microbiome, and the vascular system. This review was conducted to explore the therapeutic potential of repurposing metformin, as its effects align with many of these dysfunctional pathways.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review. The authors synthesized findings from a wide range of previous research, including laboratory (*in vitro*) studies, animal models, and clinical trials. They connected metformin's known effects on cellular pathways—such as the electron transport chain, mTOR signaling, and inflammation—to the specific pathological findings documented in ME/CFS and LC research.

## What has been found?

The review consolidates evidence that metformin acts on multiple systems relevant to ME/CFS and LC. It can inhibit mitochondrial complexes I and IV, which may reduce the production of damaging free radicals and lessen the strain on the dysfunctional complex V observed in ME/CFS cells. The drug also modulates the mTOR pathway to improve energy regulation, exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, stabilizes mast cells, and beneficially alters the gut microbiome. Notably, a major clinical trial found that metformin taken during an acute COVID-19 infection reduced the incidence of Long COVID by 41%.

## Discussion

The authors propose that metformin is unlikely to be a single cure but could be a key component of a multi-faceted treatment strategy. They suggest that future treatment approaches should target different domains of the illness simultaneously, using metformin to address cellular stress and microbiome issues while other therapies target autonomic and neurocognitive impairments. The significant gastrointestinal side effects of metformin are a noted complication, though evidence suggests much of the drug's benefit may come from its action within the gut itself.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that metformin is an intriguing, multi-action drug with a strong rationale for use in ME/CFS and LC. Its ability to regulate metabolism, reduce cellular damage, and restore gut health is expected to offer meaningful symptomatic relief. They recommend future research should focus on multi-arm randomized controlled trials to determine optimal dosing and delivery methods (such as delayed-release preparations) specifically for the ME/CFS and LC populations.
