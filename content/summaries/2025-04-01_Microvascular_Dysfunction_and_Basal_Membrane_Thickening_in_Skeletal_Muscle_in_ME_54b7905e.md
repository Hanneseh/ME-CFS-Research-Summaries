## Summary

This research provides powerful visual evidence for a biological cause of muscle-related symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID. The discovery of thickened and narrowed capillaries, along with fewer capillaries in ME/CFS, helps explain why patients experience severe fatigue and post-exertional malaise. These physical blockages at a microscopic level can restrict blood flow, limit oxygen and nutrient delivery, and prevent waste clearance in the muscles. This moves the understanding of the illness away from subjective symptoms towards a defined, structural pathology and opens up new avenues for developing diagnostics and treatments aimed at repairing or improving microvascular function.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the underlying physical causes of muscle fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) in ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. Researchers hypothesized that a "peripheral oxygenation deficit," caused by an inability to match oxygen delivery with the muscles' oxygen consumption, was a key factor. To test this, they examined the structure and function of the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) in the skeletal muscles of patients and healthy controls.

## Why was it researched?

Patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID suffer from debilitating muscle fatigue and PEM, but the biological reasons for these symptoms are not well understood. This research was prompted by the need to identify a concrete physiological mechanism that could explain why physical exertion leads to a severe worsening of symptoms. The study aimed to find physical evidence of microvascular defects that could impair oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle tissue.

## How was it researched?

This was a comparative laboratory study analyzing patient tissue and physiological responses to exercise. The researchers recruited three groups: ME/CFS patients, Long COVID patients, and healthy controls. They measured cardio-pulmonary function and muscle oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during and after an exercise test. Additionally, they took biopsies from the *vastus lateralis* (a large thigh muscle) to assess capillary density (capillarization), collagen IV deposits, and the ultrastructure of the capillaries using advanced microscopy.

## What has been found?

The study found significant structural abnormalities in the muscle capillaries of both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients compared to healthy controls. The capillary basement membrane, a layer surrounding the vessel, was significantly thicker, and there was increased deposition of collagen IV. This thickening resulted in a significantly smaller lumen radius, narrowing the channel through which blood flows. Furthermore, ME/CFS patients specifically showed significantly lower capillary density (fewer capillaries per muscle fiber). These structural issues correlated with reduced exercise capacity and were accompanied by signs of endothelial stress and damage to the cells lining the capillaries.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how the observed abnormalities—reduced lumen space, thickening of the basement membrane, and endothelial dysfunction—directly impair the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to muscle cells and hinder the removal of metabolic waste products. These microvascular defects create a physiological environment that predisposes patients to premature fatigue. The findings suggest that the problem is not just about blood flow volume but also about the diffusion capacity, which is compromised by the thickened vessel walls.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit significant and pathological structural changes in their muscle microvasculature. These abnormalities provide a direct physical explanation for the impaired oxygen supply and exercise intolerance characteristic of these illnesses. Future work will likely focus on validating these findings in larger patient cohorts and investigating the upstream mechanisms causing this capillary damage, which could lead to new diagnostic tools and targeted treatments.
