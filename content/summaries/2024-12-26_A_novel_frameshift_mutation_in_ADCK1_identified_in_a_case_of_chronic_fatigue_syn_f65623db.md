## Summary

This study provides strong evidence linking a specific genetic defect (a mutation in the ADCK1 gene) to mitochondrial dysfunction and severe symptoms in a patient with ME/CFS. The remarkable, life-changing improvement the patient experienced on a combination of supplements that support cellular energy production (5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone) suggests that her illness was directly tied to this biological issue. While this is a single case, it reinforces the mitochondrial dysfunction theory in ME/CFS and opens a potential path toward personalized medicine, where genetic testing could identify patients who may benefit from therapies that target cellular energy metabolism.

## What was researched?

This case report details the clinical journey of a 35-year-old woman with a long history of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The study investigated a potential genetic cause for her condition by performing a comprehensive exon analysis and documented her response to a treatment aimed at supporting mitochondrial function.

## Why was it researched?

The underlying cause of CFS is unknown, but emerging evidence points towards mitochondrial dysfunction as a key factor. Researchers are looking for specific biological markers and targeted treatments. This case presented an opportunity to explore a potential genetic link to mitochondrial problems in CFS and to assess the effectiveness of therapies designed to improve cellular energy production.

## How was it researched?

This was a single-patient case study. The patient, a 35-year-old Japanese woman with CFS since age 11, had previously failed to respond to conventional treatments. Her symptoms and quality of life were monitored over several years, including tracking her Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scores, while she was treated with supplements intended to enhance mitochondrial function. To investigate a genetic cause, comprehensive exon analysis was performed on the patient and two family members, followed by cDNA sequencing to confirm the functional impact of the identified mutation.

## What has been found?

Genetic analysis identified a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in the ADCK1 gene, which is known to be important for mitochondrial function. The patient experienced significant, dose-dependent improvements in fatigue and daily activities after treatment with oral 5-aminolevulinic acid with sodium ferrous citrate (5-ALA/SFC) 💊 and ubiquinone 💊 (also known as coenzyme Q10). While previous treatment with levocarnitine 💊 had provided some benefit, the combination of 5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone led to a much more substantial and sustained improvement in her condition.

## Discussion

The authors note that the patient's dramatic clinical improvement with mitochondrial-supportive supplements strongly suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction was a key driver of her illness. A limitation of the study is that the father's DNA was unavailable, which prevented the researchers from confirming if the ADCK1 mutation was inherited or occurred spontaneously (*de novo*). It also remains to be conclusively proven that this specific heterozygous mutation is sufficient to cause CFS, though the evidence is highly suggestive.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that this case highlights the importance of considering mitochondrial dysfunction in CFS and supports the potential of combining 5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone as a therapeutic strategy. The identification of the ADCK1 mutation suggests a genetic predisposition to mitochondrial issues in some CFS cases. The authors recommend further functional studies and family-based investigations to confirm the role of this ADCK1 mutation in CFS.
