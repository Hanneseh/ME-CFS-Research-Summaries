## 🛠️ Transparent Process
This site is semi-automated to allow me to monitor a high volume of research as a non-expert.
- **Source:** I aggregate alerts from PubMed, Google Scholar, and medRxiv.
- **AI Agent:** Every 4–6 weeks, a custom Gemini-powered agent creates these summaries.
- **Open Source:** You can find the agent's logic and prompts on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hanneseh/ME-CFS-Research-Summaries).
- **AI Integration:** Feel free to [copy the full archive](https://github.com/Hanneseh/ME-CFS-Research-Summaries/blob/main/all_summaries.md?plain=1) into your own AI tools for deep research.
