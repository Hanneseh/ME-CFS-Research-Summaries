## Summary

This study identifies a specific molecular abnormality in the brains of people with Long COVID "brain fog": a widespread increase in excitatory AMPA receptors. This finding provides a potential biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, suggesting that excessive excitatory signaling could be disrupting normal brain function. The research is significant because it moves beyond general observations of brain inflammation and offers a precise, measurable biomarker that can distinguish patients from healthy controls with high accuracy. Most importantly, by identifying a specific molecular target, it opens a direct and tangible path toward testing targeted treatments, such as drugs that block AMPA receptors, to potentially alleviate cognitive symptoms.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the density of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), which are crucial for excitatory brain signaling, in patients with cognitive impairment from Long COVID (Cog-LC). The researchers aimed to compare AMPAR levels between Cog-LC patients and healthy controls and to determine if these measurements could serve as an objective diagnostic tool.

## Why was it researched?

The neurological mechanisms behind the cognitive impairment or "brain fog" seen in Long COVID are poorly understood. While previous imaging studies have shown structural or metabolic brain changes, they haven't identified specific molecular targets. Since synapses are fundamental to brain function, the researchers hypothesized that investigating AMPARs, key molecules in learning and memory, could reveal the underlying pathology of Cog-LC.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. The researchers analyzed brain scans from 30 patients diagnosed with Cog-LC and compared them to existing scans from 80 healthy controls. They used a specific PET tracer, $[^{11}C]K-2$, which binds to AMPA receptors on the surface of neurons, to measure and compare receptor density. The team also measured plasma levels of inflammatory molecules (cytokines and chemokines) and used a machine learning algorithm to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the PET data.

## What has been found?

The study found a significant and widespread increase in AMPAR density across large parts of the brain in patients with Cog-LC compared to healthy controls. Higher AMPAR density was correlated with poorer performance on cognitive tests. The researchers also found that AMPAR density was positively correlated with the inflammatory marker TNFSF12 and negatively with the chemokine CCL2 in the blood. A machine learning model trained on the PET scan data was able to distinguish Cog-LC patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91.2% specificity.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the systemic increase in AMPARs could be driven by sustained neuroinflammation, a known feature of Long COVID, potentially disrupting the brain's normal signal processing and leading to cognitive deficits. Key limitations of the study include that the findings are correlational, not necessarily causal, and the patient cohort was restricted to Asians living in Japan, which may limit generalizability. The study did not directly measure inhibitory receptors, so the full impact on the brain's excitation/inhibition balance is unknown.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that increased brain-wide AMPAR density is a key pathological feature of cognitive Long COVID. They propose that AMPAR PET imaging with $[^{11}C]K-2$ is a promising tool for developing an objective diagnostic framework for the condition. The findings also suggest that AMPAR antagonists, such as the existing epilepsy drug perampanel 💊, could be a potential therapeutic strategy. The authors call for larger clinical studies to validate these findings and test this therapeutic hypothesis.
