- **What was researched?**
This study aimed to analyze and compare autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia) and small fiber neuropathy (SFN) in patients with post-COVID condition and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) against a group of healthy controls. The researchers also investigated how these conditions might relate to symptoms like cognitive impairment and fatigue.
- **Why was it researched?**
Post-COVID condition and ME/CFS share many symptoms, including fatigue, "brain fog," and autonomic issues. Previous research has described both dysautonomia and SFN in these patient groups, and it's hypothesized that these neurological problems could be an underlying cause of the debilitating fatigue. This study sought to systematically compare these factors across both illnesses to better understand their similarities and differences.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a comparative study involving 87 patients with post-COVID condition, 50 with ME/CFS, and 50 healthy controls. Autonomic function was assessed using hemodynamic tests like the Tilt Table Test, Valsalva maneuver, and deep breathing tests. The presence of SFN was evaluated using Sudoscan, which measures sweat gland function controlled by small nerves, and by testing the nerves' response to heat and cold stimuli (evoked potentials). All participants also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation.
- **What has been found?**
Both ME/CFS and post-COVID patients exhibited significantly higher heart rates at rest and during standing compared to healthy controls. A high percentage of patients met the criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): 31% of the ME/CFS group and 13.8% of the post-COVID group. Both patient groups showed significantly delayed nerve responses to heat stimuli, suggesting damage to small, unmyelinated C-type nerve fibers. Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients had abnormal Sudoscan results in their hands compared to their feet, indicating a "non-length-dependent" SFN, where the neuropathy is patchy rather than starting at the extremities.
- **Discussion:**
The authors noted several limitations, including unequal sample sizes for the patient groups and a different gender distribution across groups, which could introduce bias. They also pointed out that a surprisingly high number of healthy controls showed some pathological autonomic results, which might have masked some of the differences between the patient and control groups. Despite these limitations, the study is highlighted as the first to directly compare these specific autonomic and neuropathic characteristics across both ME/CFS and post-COVID patient cohorts.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors concluded that both ME/CFS and post-COVID condition are characterized by inappropriate tachycardia, a high prevalence of POTS, and evidence of sensory small fiber neuropathy. They recommend future studies with larger control groups to establish clear pathological thresholds for these tests. The researchers also suggest using additional techniques like corneal confocal microscopy to further assess SFN and analyzing for autoantibodies to explore a potential autoimmune cause for these conditions.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong, objective evidence supporting the biological basis of symptoms in both ME/CFS and post-COVID. It demonstrates that dysautonomia and small fiber neuropathy are significant, measurable features shared by both illnesses. The confirmation of a high prevalence of POTS, along with physical evidence of damage to small nerve fibers (from delayed heat response times), validates common patient complaints. The finding of a non-length-dependent SFN is a key detail that may help guide future diagnostic efforts and research into the mechanisms of nerve damage in these conditions.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers confirmed that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID often have problems with their autonomic nervous system, causing issues like a very fast heart rate when standing (POTS). The study also found physical evidence of damage to the tiny nerve fibers that sense temperature. These findings help prove that the symptoms are caused by real, biological problems and could lead to better diagnostic tests in the future.
