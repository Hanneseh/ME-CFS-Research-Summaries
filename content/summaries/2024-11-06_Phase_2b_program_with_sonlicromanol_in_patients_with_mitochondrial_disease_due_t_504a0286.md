## Summary

This study provides encouraging evidence for sonlicromanol, a drug targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. While the initial, short-term placebo-controlled results were mixed, the one-year follow-up showed significant improvements in key symptoms like fatigue, pain, mood, and physical function in patients with a confirmed mitochondrial disease. For the ME/CFS community, this is highly relevant as mitochondrial dysfunction is a leading hypothesis for the illness, and a successful treatment in a related disease could open up a new and important avenue for future ME/CFS research. The promising long-term results and good safety profile justify moving this drug into a larger, more definitive Phase 3 trial.

## What was researched?

This Phase 2b clinical trial program evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the drug sonlicromanol in adults with a specific genetic mitochondrial disease caused by the m.3243A>G mutation. The program consisted of a short-term, placebo-controlled study to select the best dose, followed by a one-year, open-label extension study to assess long-term effects.

## Why was it researched?

Primary mitochondrial diseases are a group of rare conditions with very few approved treatments, creating an urgent need for new therapeutic options. Sonlicromanol 💊 is a promising drug candidate that targets key pathways related to metabolic and inflammatory distress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. A previous, smaller Phase 2a study had already demonstrated that the drug had a favorable safety profile and showed a positive effect on mood and cognition.

## How was it researched?

The study was a two-part Phase 2b trial. The first part was a 28-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 27 patients, who each received two doses of sonlicromanol (50 mg and 100 mg twice daily) and a placebo in a cross-over design. Following this, patients who completed the initial trial were eligible to enter a 52-week open-label extension study, where all 15 participants received 100 mg of sonlicromanol twice daily. Efficacy was measured using a wide range of clinical and patient-reported outcomes assessing cognition, fatigue, mood, pain, and physical function.

## What has been found?

In the short-term randomized trial, sonlicromanol 💊 did not meet its primary goal of improving attention, as measured by the Cogstate IDN test. However, a post-hoc analysis suggested that patients who were more severely affected at baseline did show a significant improvement. This analysis also revealed positive signals for improvements in depression (BDI, HADS-D) and self-reported cognitive failures (CFQ). In the 52-week open-label extension, patients showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvements across multiple areas, including fatigue (NQF), physical quality of life (SF-12 PCS), pain (MPQ), and balance (mini-BESTest). The drug was well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile over the year-long treatment period.

## Discussion

The authors suggest the failure to meet the primary endpoint in the short-term trial could be due to the high variability in symptoms among patients and the multisystemic nature of the disease. They highlight that the positive effects of the drug were more apparent in patients who were more symptomatic at the start of treatment. The paper also notes that the 28-day trial duration was likely too short to capture the full benefits, which became more evident in the 52-week extension study. The main limitation of the extension study is the absence of a placebo group, which makes it challenging to definitively attribute all observed improvements solely to the drug.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a 100 mg twice-daily dose of sonlicromanol is safe, well-tolerated, and shows efficacy in clinically relevant domains for patients with m.3243A>G mitochondrial disease. The findings from this Phase 2b program provide a strong basis for selecting appropriate endpoints and patient populations for a larger, 52-week Phase 3 randomized controlled trial to confirm these benefits.
