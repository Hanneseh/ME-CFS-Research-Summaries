## Summary

This review consolidates the earliest clinical evidence for using Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) to treat long covid, finding that in small, uncontrolled studies, patients reported significant improvements in fatigue, pain, brain fog, sleep, and daily function. While these initial results are promising, the lack of placebo-controlled trials means we cannot yet be certain that LDN is responsible for these benefits. The study highlights LDN as an important candidate for future treatment, underscoring the urgent need for the larger, more rigorous randomized trials that are already in progress to provide definitive answers.

## What was researched?

This systematic review aimed to evaluate all available evidence on the effectiveness of low dose naltrexone (LDN) for alleviating the symptoms of long covid, such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and pain.

## Why was it researched?

Long covid is a debilitating chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, creating an urgent need for effective treatments. Due to the significant symptom overlap between long covid and ME/CFS, and shared biological abnormalities, researchers hypothesized that low dose naltrexone 💊, an off-label medication sometimes used for ME/CFS and other neuroimmune disorders, might also be beneficial for long covid patients.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic review where researchers searched medical databases and trial registries for all studies on LDN for long covid published up to May 1, 2025. They intended to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pre-post studies. After screening 226 records, they found no RCTs and based their analysis on four observational pre-post studies from the USA and Ireland, which included a total of 155 patients. The data from these studies were pooled for a meta-analysis to calculate the overall effect on various symptoms.

## What has been found?

The review found no randomized controlled trials. However, the pooled analysis of four small pre-post studies showed that LDN was associated with moderate improvements in fatigue, brain fog, and sleep quality. It showed large improvements in pain and daily functioning. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies that assessed safety.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that the primary limitation is the low certainty of the evidence because all included studies lacked a control or placebo group. This makes it impossible to determine if the observed improvements were caused by LDN or by other factors like the natural course of the illness, regression to the mean, or a placebo effect. They also note that the use of different outcome measures across studies and the potential for publication bias are further limitations.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that while preliminary observational evidence suggests LDN may improve key long covid symptoms, the evidence is of low certainty. They state that well-powered, randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings, establish efficacy, determine optimal dosing and duration, and confirm safety. The review notes that three such trials are currently underway.
