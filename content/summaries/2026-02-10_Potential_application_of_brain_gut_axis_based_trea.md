## Summary

This research reinforces the emerging scientific understanding that the gut and the brain are deeply interconnected in chronic fatigue conditions. By demonstrating that treatments targeting either the gut microbiome or the nervous system can lead to measurable symptom relief, the study offers hope for more integrated treatment models. It particularly identifies synbiotics and specific nerve stimulation techniques as viable tools for patients who have not responded to traditional therapies.

## What was researched?

This study explored the potential of brain-gut axis-modulating treatments, such as nerve stimulation and microbiome interventions, for managing fatigue and other symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID. It combined a clinical case report of a patient treated with electroacupuncture with a systematic review of eight randomized controlled trials.

## Why was it researched?

Both ME/CFS and Long COVID involve shared symptoms like persistent fatigue and gastrointestinal issues, which are increasingly linked to brain-gut axis dysfunction. Researchers aimed to clarify how targeting pathways like neuroinflammation, gut dysbiosis, and intestinal permeability could offer new therapeutic strategies.

## How was it researched?

The authors documented a 12-week case study of a post-COVID ME/CFS patient treated with electroacupuncture-based deep peroneal nerve stimulation to potentiate the vagal reflex. Simultaneously, they conducted a systematic review of trials evaluating gut microbiome modulators like synbiotics 💊 and herbal interventions 💊, as well as nerve stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation.

## What has been found?

The case patient showed significant reduction in total fatigue, with early improvements in motivation and delayed gains in physical function. The systematic review found that synbiotics and herbal interventions effectively reduced fatigue and post-exertional malaise by altering the gut microbiome and central nervous system metabolism. Additionally, nerve stimulation combined with exercise was found to improve fatigue, whereas standalone stimulation showed limited efficacy.

## Discussion

The study highlights that combined therapies may be more effective than single interventions, potentially due to their synergistic effects on gut barrier integrity and neuroinflammation. However, the review was limited by the small number of high-quality clinical trials available for these specific conditions. The transient systemic symptom flares observed in the case patient suggest that recovery trajectories can be complex.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Brain-gut axis-based interventions represent a promising avenue for treating ME/CFS and Long COVID symptoms. Future research should prioritize larger randomized trials to refine personalized microbiome-based and neuromodulation protocols.
