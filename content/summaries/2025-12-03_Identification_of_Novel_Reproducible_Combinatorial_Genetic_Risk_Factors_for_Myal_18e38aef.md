## Summary

This landmark study provides robust evidence that ME/CFS is a biological illness with a deep-seated genetic foundation, potentially silencing long-standing debates about its origins. By identifying over 22,000 genetic combinations, it explains the extreme variety of symptoms seen in patients and shifts the focus toward "stratified medicine," where treatments are tailored to a patient's specific genetic profile. The significant overlap with Long COVID is particularly promising, as it suggests that research and potential treatments for one condition may directly benefit the other, accelerating the search for effective therapies. While the study indicates that one "cure-all" drug is unlikely, it opens the door for a more precise, personalized approach to managing the disease.

## What was researched?

This study utilized advanced combinatorial genetic analysis to identify specific sets of genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS). The researchers also compared these genetic risk factors with those previously identified in Long COVID to determine the biological commonalities between the two conditions.

## Why was it researched?

Previous genetic research into ME/CFS using traditional methods has struggled to find reproducible results, largely because the disease is highly complex and affects multiple body systems. By moving beyond looking at single genes in isolation, this study aimed to uncover the complex "signatures" of combined genes that drive the disease, which could lead to better diagnostic tools and personalized treatments.

## How was it researched?

The researchers applied the PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform to analyze genomic data from 14,767 participants in the DecodeME cohort and compared them to healthy controls from the UK Biobank. The study searched for combinations of 1 to 4 genetic variants (SNPs) that were significantly more frequent in ME/CFS patients across three independent patient groups to ensure reproducibility. They then mapped these variants to specific genes and compared 180 genes previously linked to Long COVID with the new ME/CFS findings.

## What has been found?

The analysis identified 22,411 reproducible genetic signatures involving 2,311 unique genes that are consistently associated with ME/CFS. Individuals with the highest number of these signatures were 1.64 times more likely to have the disease than those with the lowest count. The study highlighted 259 "core" genes linked to four primary disease mechanisms: neurological dysregulation, inflammation, cellular stress responses, and calcium signaling. Furthermore, 76 of the 180 genes previously linked to Long COVID were found to be shared with ME/CFS, suggesting a significant but partial overlap in the underlying biology of the two illnesses.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the limitations of the study, noting that it is currently a preprint and has not yet undergone peer review. They acknowledge that while the large DecodeME cohort provides significant power, the study relies on self-reported data and questionnaires, though these were validated against clinical diagnostic criteria. They emphasize that the findings prove ME/CFS is a polygenic and highly diverse condition, meaning no single drug is likely to help every patient.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that ME/CFS has a clear, multisystemic genetic basis, which provides the foundation for future clinical trials. They identified dozens of "drug repurposing" opportunities—existing medications that target the newly discovered pathways—and plan to explore how these can be used to treat specific patient subgroups. Future work will focus on developing biomarker-led trials to match patients with the treatments most likely to address their specific biological drivers.
