## Summary

This study identifies a distinct autoimmune signature in Long COVID patients, characterized by elevated autoantibodies targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These findings support the theory that Long COVID may be driven by an autoimmune process similar to ME/CFS, offering potential diagnostic biomarkers and justifying the investigation of immune-modulating treatments. The correlation between these autoantibodies and severe fatigue suggests they play a functional role in the persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the presence and clinical relevance of autoantibodies targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in patients with Long COVID compared to asymptomatic individuals.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers sought to identify reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Long COVID, testing the hypothesis that the condition involves an autoimmune disruption of the autonomic nervous system.

## How was it researched?

This prospective case-control study analyzed 15 participants: 11 with severe Long COVID and 4 asymptomatic post-COVID controls. Researchers measured autoantibodies against adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, morning cortisol levels, and T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2.

## What has been found?

Long COVID patients showed a trend toward higher levels of GPCR autoantibodies and significantly higher fatigue scores compared to controls. The study also found significantly lower morning cortisol levels and weaker T-cell responses in the Long COVID group. Specific markers like the β2-adrenergic receptor-Ab were linked to the symptom profile.

## Discussion

The primary limitation is the very small sample size, which restricts the statistical power of some findings. However, the consistent trend toward higher autoantibody levels in symptomatic patients suggests a coherent autoimmune signature.

## Conclusion & Future Work

GPCR autoantibodies represent promising biomarkers for a subset of Long COVID patients. Future research should explore treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin 💊 or immunoadsorption to target these specific autoantibodies.
