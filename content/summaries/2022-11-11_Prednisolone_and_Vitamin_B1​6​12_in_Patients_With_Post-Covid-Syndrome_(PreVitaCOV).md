## Purpose of the Trial

This trial investigated the effectiveness of treating Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PC19S) with the corticosteroid Prednisolone 💊 and a Vitamin B compound 💊 (B1, B6, B12). The study aimed to determine if these treatments, known for their anti-inflammatory and nerve-supporting properties respectively, could alleviate disabling symptoms like fatigue, cognitive issues, and shortness of breath in affected patients. The trial tested the medications both individually and in combination against a placebo.

## Trial Design & Procedure

- **Duration:** The treatment period for participants was 28 days.
    - **Design:** This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants were randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants, care providers, nor investigators knew who was receiving which treatment.
    - **Groups:** Participants were split into four groups: one receiving Prednisolone and a placebo for Vitamin B, one receiving Vitamin B and a placebo for Prednisolone, one receiving both active treatments, and one receiving a placebo for both.
    - **Procedure:** Participants took oral medication daily for 28 days. The Prednisolone group received a higher dose for the first 5 days, followed by a lower dose for the remaining 23 days.
