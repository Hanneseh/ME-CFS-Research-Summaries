## Summary

This landmark study, the largest of its kind for ME/CFS, provides the first strong scientific evidence that the illness has a clear biological basis rooted in genetics. The findings link ME/CFS risk to specific genes involved in the immune system's response to infection and genes active in the brain, aligning with the common patient experience of post-viral onset and neurological symptoms like pain and brain fog. By identifying a genetic link to chronic pain but not to depression, this research offers crucial biological evidence that distinguishes ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions. This provides a vital foundation for future research to develop objective diagnostic markers and targeted treatments.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). By conducting a large genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers compared the DNA of thousands of ME/CFS patients with a large population of healthy controls to find genetic risk factors that could point to the underlying biological mechanisms of the disease.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a common, disabling illness with no known cause, diagnostic test, or effective treatments. Previous genetic studies have been too small to produce robust and replicable findings. Identifying genetic risk factors is a high research priority for patients and is considered a critical step toward developing diagnostics and effective therapies.

## How was it researched?

This was a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) co-produced by scientists and people with ME/CFS. The study recruited participants from the UK, collecting DNA from saliva samples. The final analysis compared the DNA of 15,579 ME/CFS cases of European ancestry against 259,909 healthy controls from the UK Biobank, using stringent case criteria that required a professional diagnosis and the presence of post-exertional malaise.

## What has been found?

The study discovered eight distinct genetic loci (regions in the genome) that are significantly associated with ME/CFS. Three of these loci are located near genes involved in the immune response to infection (BTN2A2, OLFM4, and RABGAP1L). One locus, near the gene CA10, shares a common genetic signal with multisite chronic pain. Importantly, the study found no evidence that these genetic risk factors for ME/CFS are shared with depression or anxiety.

## Discussion

The authors attribute the study's success to its high statistical power, achieved through its large size, and its use of stringent case-definition criteria requiring post-exertional malaise. They note that the findings were not replicated in other large biobank analyses, which they suggest could be due to differences in how cases were defined in those cohorts (i.e., not strictly requiring ME/CFS's hallmark symptom). The study was limited to common genetic variants in people of European ancestry, and the authors state the need for further research in more diverse populations and for rarer genetic variants.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that this study provides the first robust evidence that common genetic variation contributes to the risk of developing ME/CFS, indicating that both immunological and neurological processes are involved in its pathology. These findings provide a firm biological foundation for ME/CFS research, which should help reduce stigma and accelerate the search for treatments. Future work will include analyzing DNA from all genetic ancestries, fine-mapping the identified genetic regions, and sequencing whole genomes to search for rare variants.
