## Summary

This research identifies a potential new way to measure a specific type of stress on the kidneys in ME/CFS patients using the protein SMPDL3B, even when standard kidney tests appear normal. This provides a biological basis for subtle kidney involvement in the disease and connects it to the systemic metabolic and mitochondrial problems frequently reported. The finding that patients can be sorted into three distinct groups based on their SMPDL3B levels is a significant step towards personalized medicine, potentially explaining why the illness presents differently among individuals. This work offers a promising, non-invasive biomarker that could help in diagnosing, subgrouping, and monitoring ME/CFS in the future.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether levels of a protein, Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase Acid-Like 3B (SMPDL3B), in the plasma and urine could serve as a biomarker for subtle, subclinical kidney alterations in people with ME/CFS. Researchers also explored the connection between SMPDL3B, renal function, and broader metabolic profiles to better understand the disease's mechanisms.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a poorly understood multisystem illness lacking objective diagnostic tests. Previous research has pointed to metabolic disturbances and potential organ-specific issues, including mild kidney involvement. Since SMPDL3B is crucial for the function of podocytes (specialized kidney cells) and has been previously linked to ME/CFS severity, the authors hypothesized that dysregulation of this protein could connect systemic metabolic problems with renal stress in the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a cross-sectional study that analyzed plasma and urine samples from 56 ME/CFS patients and 16 matched healthy controls. The researchers measured SMPDL3B levels, estimated renal clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and performed comprehensive metabolomic profiling of plasma. The findings were analyzed to identify differences between groups, correlations between biomarkers and clinical data, and to explore sex-specific patterns.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients had significantly lower urine-to-plasma ratios of soluble SMPDL3B and reduced renal clearance compared to controls, suggesting early-stage kidney impairment even with normal plasma creatinine levels. This ratio was found to be an independent predictor of kidney clearance. The study also identified significant alterations in plasma metabolites related to renal function and mitochondrial energy production, such as decreased succinic acid and 1,5-anhydrosorbitol. Furthermore, female ME/CFS patients exhibited more pronounced alterations in SMPDL3B levels, lower kidney clearance, and greater symptom severity than male patients. Patient stratification based on plasma SMPDL3B levels revealed three distinct subgroups with unique renal, metabolic, and lipid profiles.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the study's integrative approach as a major strength, combining biomarker analysis with renal function and metabolomics. Key limitations acknowledged include the cross-sectional design, which prevents determining causality, and the relatively small sample size, which may limit the statistical power of subgroup analyses. The lack of direct tissue validation (e.g., via kidney biopsy) is also noted, suggesting that future studies could provide deeper mechanistic insights.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that altered SMPDL3B dynamics are associated with subclinical renal dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities in ME/CFS. The urine-to-plasma SMPDL3B ratio emerges as a promising, non-invasive biomarker for detecting early renal stress in this population. The authors suggest that these findings underscore the heterogeneity of ME/CFS and support the need for larger, longitudinal studies to validate these biomarkers and develop more personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
