## Summary

This study identified a potential biomarker for PASC (Long Covid) by analyzing 195 different peptides in urine. This "PASC195" signature, which is heavily linked to collagen dysregulation, was able to successfully distinguish PASC patients from both healthy people and, notably, from patients with non-COVID-19 ME/CFS. This finding suggests that while PASC and ME/CFS share symptoms, their underlying molecular profiles may be different, which is a critical step for developing specific diagnostic tests. The discovery of this urinary signature provides a non-invasive tool that could, after much more research, complement or replace subjective symptom-based diagnosis. The study's computational analysis also pointed to existing drug classes (GLP-1 RA 💊 and MRA 💊) as potential treatments, offering a new direction for future clinical trials. However, the authors' inability to validate this signature in a second, different cohort highlights that the biomarker is not yet ready for clinical use and requires significant further validation.

## What was researched?

This study researched whether analyzing peptides (small protein fragments) in urine, a process called urinary peptidomics, could be used to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

## Why was it researched?

Currently, diagnosing PASC relies on symptom-based criteria, which can be uncertain and subjective. The researchers hypothesized that analyzing urinary peptides could provide a more objective, non-invasive way to diagnose PASC and offer new insights into its underlying disease mechanisms, which remain unclear.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study that used capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) to analyze urine samples from 50 PASC patients (approximately 10 months post-infection) and 50 controls. The control group included 42 healthy individuals and 8 patients with non-COVID-19-associated myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The researchers used a machine learning model (support vector machine) to identify significant differences in peptide abundance and build a diagnostic classifier from a training set (n=60), which was then tested on a separate validation set (n=40).

## What has been found?

The researchers identified a unique signature of 195 urinary peptides, named **PASC195**, that was significantly different in PASC patients compared to controls. This signature, characterized mainly by a predominant abundance of collagen alpha chains, was able to effectively distinguish PASC cases from both healthy controls and non-COVID-19 ME/CFS patients with high accuracy (AUC of 0.962) in the validation set. The identified peptides suggest PASC involves dysregulated collagen, ongoing inflammation, and endothelial damage. A computational (in silico) analysis also suggested that GLP-1 RA 💊 and MRA 💊 (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) might be potentially beneficial interventions.

## Discussion

The authors note that the PASC195 classifier could not be validated in a separate, independent cohort (UriCoV), which limits the generalizability of the findings. They suggest this was likely due to differences in cohort selection, how "cases" were defined (clinician-diagnosed vs. self-reported), and the timing of sample collection (10 months vs. 3 years post-infection). The study was also limited by its small sample size, which prevented subgroup analyses (e.g., by sex or age).

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that they have identified a promising, non-invasive urinary peptide signature (PASC195) that could potentially advance PASC diagnostics. They state that this signature reflects the underlying molecular pathophysiology of PASC. Future longitudinal studies with larger, more diverse cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and validate the biomarker.
