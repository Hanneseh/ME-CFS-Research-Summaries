# ME/CFS Research Summaries

[Deutsche Version](README-de.md)

## Introduction

This repository provides summaries of key research publications on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID. The goal is to offer a transparent, chronological overview of the scientific progress for patients, caregivers, and their families.

Motivated by a close family member with severe ME/CFS, I monitor new research using PubMed and Google alerts. Promising studies are summarized using a custom AI agent and then manually reviewed for relevance before being added to the list below. You can search this page for the ðŸ’Š emoji to find all mentions of medications and substances being researched.

To provide a high-level overview of the field, the latest research roundup (marked with a ðŸŽ¯) synthesizes all the summarized studies into a single, structured analysis. It tracks the evolution of the science across three key areas: our understanding of the disease's biology, the development of diagnostic tools, and the search for effective treatments. This section serves as an executive summary of the current state of ME/CFS research.

I've made this repository, along with the AI prompts, public so you can follow the progress yourself. If you believe an important study is missing or wish to contribute, please open an Issue or a Pull Request.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. The summaries may contain errors or omissions, including those introduced by AI-generated content. No responsibility is taken for factual inaccuracies. This is not a comprehensive or exhaustive list of all published research on ME/CFS or related conditions. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis

### ðŸŽ¯ 2025-09-01 - Research Roundup

**I. Evolution of Disease Understanding**
The scientific understanding of ME/CFS is consolidating around a model of a post-viral, autoimmune disease with a clear genetic basis, causing multi-system dysfunction centered on the neuro-immune axis and cellular metabolism. Landmark genetic research has identified specific risk genes involved in the immune response to infection, firmly establishing a biological foundation and distinguishing ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions [2025-08-06](#2025-08-06-initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome). This immune dysregulation often manifests as autoimmunity, where patient-derived antibodies can directly cause mitochondrial fragmentation in healthy cells, providing a mechanistic link between the immune system and the disease's profound energy impairment [2025-08-10](#2025-08-10-mecfs-and-pasc-patient-derived-immunoglobulin-complexes-disrupt-mitochondrial-function-and-alter-inflammatory-marker-secretion). Viral triggers like EBV are thought to initiate this process through "molecular mimicry," where autoantibodies targeting viral proteins also attack the body's own G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), disrupting critical autonomic functions [2025-08-29](#2025-08-29-advancing-research-on-regulatory-autoantibodies-targeting-gpcrs-insights-from-the-5th-international-symposium) [2025-08-30](#2025-08-30-exploratory-study-on-autoantibodies-to-arginine-rich-human-peptides-mimicking-epstein-barr-virus-in-women-with-post-covid-and-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome). This cascade of pathology manifests peripherally in the skeletal muscle, where microvascular damage, including thickened and narrowed capillaries, impairs oxygen delivery [2025-04-01](#2025-04-01-microvascular-dysfunction-and-basal-membrane-thickening-in-skeletal-muscle-in-mecfs-and-post-covid), leading to a toxic buildup of sodium [2022-12-09](#2022-12-09-muscle-sodium-content-in-patients-with-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome) and subsequent mitochondrial damage that worsens with exertion, explaining post-exertional malaise [2024-11-06](#2024-11-06-key-pathophysiological-role-of-skeletal-muscle-disturbance-in-post-covid-and-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-mecfs-accumulated-evidence). Centrally, this systemic dysfunction is likely orchestrated by neuroinflammation and the failure of the brain's support cells (neuroglia), which activate primitive "sickness behavior" circuits and cause the consistently observed reduction in cerebral blood flow [2025-08-19](#2025-08-19-causes-of-symptoms-and-symptom-persistence-in-long-covid-and-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome) [2022-05-09](#2022-05-09-the-pathobiology-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-the-case-for-neuroglial-failure) [2025-08-26](#2025-08-26-mapping-cerebral-blood-flow-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-mecfs-and-orthostatic-intolerance-insights-from-a-systematic-review).

**II. Evolution in Diagnostics**
The search for objective biomarkers is shifting from static measurements to dynamic tests that capture the core functional impairments of the disease. One promising approach uses microfluidics to show that red blood cells from patients have an impaired ability to speed up in response to low oxygen, a finding that correlates with oxygen delivery issues and has been developed into a machine learning model with high specificity [2025-08-11](#2025-08-11-microfluidic-assessment-of-po2-regulated-rbc-capillary-velocity-in-mecfs). Another minimally invasive "liquid biopsy" technique analyzes circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) to identify a distinct signature of widespread immune dysregulation, including T-cell exhaustion and chronic inflammation, which can distinguish patients from controls [2025-08-11](#2025-08-11-circulating-cell-free-rna-signatures-for-the-characterization-and-diagnosis-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome). Protein-based biomarkers are also advancing, with specific genetic types and structural forms of the haptoglobin protein now linked to PEM severity, offering a tool for patient stratification [2025-08-28](#2025-08-28-haptoglobin-phenotypes-and-structural-variants-associate-with-post-exertional-malaise-and-cognitive-dysfunction-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitis). Similarly, levels of soluble SMPDL3B [2025-07-07](#2025-07-07-smpdl3b-a-novel-biomarker-and-therapeutic-target-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitis) and the metabolic hormone FGF-21 [2025-08-08](#2025-08-08-circulating-fgf-21-as-a-disease-modifying-factor-associated-with-distinct-symptoms-and-cognitive-profiles-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitis-and-fibromyalgia) have been shown to correlate with disease severity and can help define distinct patient subgroups. Advanced AI models are now integrating these diverse data typesâ€”from the microbiome to the metabolomeâ€”to classify the disease with high accuracy and map specific biological disruptions to individual symptoms [2025-07-25](#2025-07-25-ai-driven-multi-omics-modeling-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome).

**III. Evolution in Finding a Cure**
Therapeutic strategies are increasingly targeting the core autoimmune and metabolic dysfunctions identified in research, with immunomodulation showing particular promise. A pilot study of the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab ðŸ’Š, which targets antibody-producing plasma cells, led to major, durable improvements in a majority of participants, supporting the autoantibody hypothesis [2025-07-09](#2025-07-09-plasma-cell-targeting-with-the-anti-cd38-antibody-daratumumab-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-a-clinical-pilot-study). Procedures like immunoadsorption ðŸ’Š [2023-10-09](#2023-10-09-observational-study-of-repeat-immunoadsorption-ria-in-post-covid-mecfs-patients-with-elevated-%C3%9F2-adrenergic-receptor-autoantibodiesan-interim-report) and H.E.L.P. apheresis [2023-05-26](#2023-05-26-long-covid-patients-successfully-treated-by-means-of-heparin-mediated-extracorporeal-ldl-precipitation-help-apheresis) that physically remove autoantibodies and inflammatory factors from the blood have also shown benefits in early trials. Given the evidence for impaired cellular autophagy, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ðŸ’Š was found to reduce fatigue and PEM in an observational study [2025-06-03](#2025-06-03-low-dose-rapamycin-alleviates-clinical-symptoms-of-fatigue-and-pem-in-mecfs-patients-via-improvement-of-autophagy). Other approaches target related pathologies, such as using pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š to improve muscle strength and autonomic function [2025-08-20](#2025-08-20-pyridostigmine-improves-hand-grip-strength-in-patients-with-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome) [2022-05-15](#2022-05-15-acute-effect-of-pyridostigmine-in-exertional-intolerance-in-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-mecfs-a-randomized-placebo-controlled-clinical-trial), vericiguat ðŸ’Š to improve microvascular blood flow [2023-06-22](#2023-06-22-study-to-investigate-improvement-in-physical-function-in-sf-36-with-vericiguat-compared-with-placebo-in-participants-with-post-covid-19-syndrome), and metformin ðŸ’Š, which has shown promise in preventing Long COVID [2023-06-08](#2023-06-08-outpatient-treatment-of-covid-19-and-incidence-of-post-covid-19-condition-over-10-months-covid-out-a-multicentre-randomised-quadruple-blind-parallel-group-phase-3-trial). Symptomatic and supportive treatments with high patient-reported benefit include low-dose naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š and low-dose aripiprazole (LDA) ðŸ’Š [2025-07-08](#2025-07-08-patient-reported-treatment-outcomes-in-mecfs-and-long-covid) [2025-08-24](#2025-08-24-praxisleitfaden-myalgische-enzephalomyelitis--chronisches-fatigue-syndrom-mecfs), which may act on dysfunctional neuroglia [2022-05-09](#2022-05-09-the-pathobiology-of-myalgic-encephalomyelitischronic-fatigue-syndrome-the-case-for-neuroglial-failure).

EBV infection is a known trigger for both ME/CFS and PCS, and previous research from this group identified elevated antibody responses to specific arginine-rich parts of EBV proteins in ME/CFS patients. This study aimed to explore the concept of "molecular mimicry," a phenomenon where the immune system, in targeting a virus like EBV, might mistakenly attack human proteins that resemble the virus, potentially contributing to disease symptoms.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an exploratory laboratory study analyzing serum samples from 45 female PCS patients (26 of whom also met ME/CFS criteria), 36 female patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS, and 34 female healthy controls. The researchers used cytometric bead array (CBA) and multiplex dot-blot assays to measure IgG antibody levels against specific EBV-derived peptides and human proteins that have similar arginine-rich sequences.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that both the PCS and ME/CFS patient groups were more likely to have autoantibodies against several human proteins that mimic EBV sequences. These targets included the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, and full-length Î±-adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins, among others. Crucially, several of these autoantibodies were positively correlated with the severity of core symptoms like autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain.
- **Discussion:**
The study is described as "exploratory," indicating that the findings are preliminary and require further confirmation. The discovery of autoantibodies that correlate with key symptoms suggests they are not just incidental but may be involved in the disease process. The authors propose molecular mimicry as a potential mechanism driving the autoimmune aspects of PCS and ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that they have identified autoantibodies targeting human proteins that mimic EBV in patients with PCS and ME/CFS. This finding suggests that molecular mimicry could play a role in the development of these conditions following an infection. Future research will likely focus on validating these autoantibodies in larger patient groups and investigating how they might directly cause symptoms.
- **Summary:**
This research provides evidence for a specific autoimmune mechanism in ME/CFS and Post-COVID Syndrome, potentially triggered by the Epstein-Barr virus. It suggests that the immune system, trying to fight EBV, may accidentally attack the body's own proteins involved in nerve function, ion transport, and circulation, which could explain a range of symptoms from brain fog to autonomic dysfunction. The identification of these specific autoantibodies is a significant step, as they could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and may become targets for future immunomodulatory treatments, though this research is still in an early, exploratory phase.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists found that in some ME/CFS and Post-COVID patients, the immune system appears to mistake parts of the body for the Epstein-Barr virus and attacks them. These mistaken attacks target important proteins, which could help explain symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, and autonomic issues. This discovery provides a new clue about the cause of these illnesses and may lead to better tests and treatments in the future.

- **What was researched?**
This paper summarizes the key insights and advancements presented at the 5th International Symposium on Regulatory Autoantibodies Targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (RAB-GPCRs). It explores the active role of these autoantibodies in various human diseases, including ME/CFS and post-COVID syndrome (PCS), and discusses their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
- **Why was it researched?**
This report was compiled to consolidate the growing body of evidence that RAB-GPCRs, once considered passive markers, are in fact active modulators of cellular signaling, immune regulation, and inflammation. The symposium aimed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and highlight this paradigm shift, discussing the involvement of these autoantibodies in a wide range of pathologies, from autoimmune diseases to post-viral syndromes.
- **How was it researched?**
This article is a comprehensive review and report of a scientific symposium. It synthesizes the presentations and discussions of leading experts from rheumatology, immunology, and neurology. The report draws upon numerous cited studies to construct a cohesive overview of the current understanding and future directions in RAB-GPCR research.
- **What has been found?**
The report highlights that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are significantly involved in ME/CFS and PCS. One major finding discussed is that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation may be a key trigger, as certain EBV proteins contain sequences that mimic human GPCRs (molecular mimicry), leading to the production of cross-reactive autoantibodies. These autoantibodies, particularly those targeting adrenergic receptors, are associated with symptom severity in ME/CFS/PCS and are thought to contribute directly to symptoms like dysautonomia, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction.
- **Discussion:**
The authors emphasize the major shift in understanding these autoantibodies, from being viewed as simple disease markers to being recognized as dynamic, functionally active agents. They discuss that these molecules can have both regulatory roles in health and pathogenic roles in disease, depending on factors like their concentration and specificity. This complexity challenges traditional immunological frameworks and calls for new conceptual models.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that functional autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are central players in the mechanisms of many immune-mediated and post-viral diseases. They strongly advocate for future research to adopt integrative, systems-level approaches that combine autoantibody profiling with other biological data (multi-omics). Such work is expected to uncover shared disease mechanisms and accelerate the development of precision diagnostics and immunomodulatory therapies.
- **Summary:**
This symposium report is highly significant for ME/CFS patients as it strongly reinforces the autoimmune nature of the illness, centering on specific autoantibodies that disrupt critical cell receptors (GPCRs) responsible for regulating functions like blood pressure and immune response. It provides a plausible mechanism for how the illness can be triggered by a common infection, suggesting that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation can lead to these harmful autoantibodies through "molecular mimicry." By identifying these autoantibodies as active drivers of pathology, this research validates the biological basis of ME/CFS symptoms and paves the way for developing objective diagnostic tests and targeted treatments, such as therapies to remove or neutralize these antibodies.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists summarized new research showing that in ME/CFS, the immune system can create harmful antibodies that interfere with important cell functions. They presented evidence that the Epstein-Barr virus might trigger this process, which helps explain how an infection can lead to chronic illness. This work strengthens the understanding of the disease's biology and points toward new ways to diagnose and treat it.

- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the protein haptoglobin (Hp) as a potential biomarker for post-exertional malaise (PEM) and cognitive dysfunction in ME. Researchers examined how different genetic types (phenotypes) and structural forms of Hp are associated with the severity of these hallmark symptoms.
- **Why was it researched?**
The molecular mechanisms driving PEM and cognitive issues in ME are still unknown. Based on emerging evidence of blood-related abnormalities and oxidative stress in the disease, the researchers hypothesized that haptoglobin, a key protein that protects against damage from hemoglobin released from red blood cells, might play a significant role. This study aimed to explore the link between Hp, PEM, and cognitive impairment.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a longitudinal case-control study involving a total of 140 ME patients and 44 healthy controls, split into two cohorts. In the first phase, researchers performed proteomic analysis on plasma samples from 61 ME patients and 20 controls before and after a standardized, non-invasive stress test designed to induce PEM. In the second phase, they validated these findings in a separate cohort of 89 ME patients and 24 controls using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze Hp concentration and structure, and correlated this with symptom severity and cognitive performance data.
- **What has been found?**
ME patients experienced a significant reduction in haptoglobin (Hp) levels after the stress test, a change not observed in healthy controls. The study revealed a genetic link to symptom severity: the Hp1-1 phenotype was associated with milder symptoms, while the Hp2-1 phenotype was more common in ME patients and linked to more severe PEM and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, ME patients with the Hp2-1 phenotype showed altered structural forms of the protein (an increase in larger oligomers), and the abundance of these forms correlated with PEM severity and cognitive impairment.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight the strength of detecting significant Hp differences even after using a standard proteomic preparation step designed to remove it, suggesting that specific, structurally altered forms of Hp are retained and are pathologically relevant in ME. A primary limitation was the small number of patients with the protective Hp1-1 phenotype, which reduced statistical power for some comparisons. The inclusion of severely ill, housebound patients, who are often excluded from research, was noted as a strength, although the authors acknowledge that more time points would be needed to fully capture the dynamics of PEM.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that a person's haptoglobin phenotype and its molecular structure modulate their physiological response to exertion in ME, providing a potential molecular explanation for PEM and its clinical variability. Hp is proposed as a promising biomarker for patient stratification and as a potential therapeutic target. Future work may explore phenotype-informed interventions, such as administering the more protective Hp1-1 form, to mitigate oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction in genetically susceptible ME patients.
- **Summary:**
This study provides the first evidence linking a specific genetic traitâ€”the type of haptoglobin protein a person hasâ€”to the severity of post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction in ME. It suggests that exertion triggers a stress response in ME patients, possibly involving red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis), and that individuals with less efficient types of haptoglobin (like Hp2-1) are less able to manage this stress, leading to worse symptoms. This research identifies a robust candidate for a PEM biomarker, offers a potential biological explanation for why PEM severity varies between patients, and opens a new avenue for developing targeted therapies, such as supplementing the more protective form of the haptoglobin protein.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists discovered that a specific blood protein, called haptoglobin, is directly linked to the severity of post-exertional malaise and brain fog. Your genetic type of this protein appears to influence how badly you crash after minimal exertion. This important finding could lead to a new biomarker test and suggests a future treatment strategy to help manage PEM.

### 2025-08-26 Mapping cerebral blood flow in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and orthostatic intolerance: insights from a systematic review
- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Elena M. Christopoulos, Darcy Tantanis, Katherine Huang, Elena K. Schneider-Futschik, Paul R. Gooley, Kegan J. Moneghetti, Christopher W. Armstrong.
    - **Institutes:** Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Bio21 Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Cardiometabolic Health and Exercise Physiology Laboratory, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.
    - **Publisher:** Journal of Translational Medicine.
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-06954-w)
- **What was researched?**
This systematic review assessed existing research to determine if cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in patients with ME/CFS and/or orthostatic intolerance (OI). The researchers specifically investigated whether having both ME/CFS and OI at the same time leads to an even greater reduction in blood flow to the brain.
- **Why was it researched?**
A large proportion of people with ME/CFS experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, which are thought to be caused by decreased cerebral blood flow. This reduction in CBF may be a major contributing factor to the cognitive impairment known as 'brain fog'. This review aimed to synthesize the evidence from numerous studies to clarify the relationship between these conditions and CBF, potentially aiding future diagnosis and treatment.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a systematic literature review that followed PRISMA guidelines. Researchers searched four major scientific databases for studies published up to February 14th, 2025, that measured CBF in ME/CFS, OI, or both. From an initial pool of 14,928 articles, 118 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were grouped into those focusing on ME/CFS alone (26 studies), OI alone (81 studies), or both conditions combined (11 studies), encompassing a total of 9,185 participants.
- **What has been found?**
The review found that CBF was significantly reduced in a substantial portion of studies focusing on ME/CFS alone (12 out of 26) and in a majority of studies on OI alone (56 out of 81) when compared to healthy controls. More importantly, a majority of the articles that directly compared ME/CFS patients with and without OI (4 out of 7) found that having both conditions resulted in a significantly larger decrease in CBF than having ME/CFS alone.
- **Discussion:**
The authors noted several limitations, including the high variability in methods used to measure CBF across studies (e.g., MRI, TCD, SPECT), which made a direct meta-analysis impossible. They also highlighted that many ME/CFS studies did not screen for OI, which may have acted as a confounding factor. Furthermore, severely ill patients are often unable to participate in studies involving orthostatic challenges like tilt table tests, meaning the most affected segment of the patient population is likely underrepresented.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that cerebral blood flow is reduced in both ME/CFS and OI, and having both conditions comorbidly amplifies this reduction. They suggest that monitoring CBF could be a valuable tool for assessing disease severity in ME/CFS patients. The researchers emphasize that understanding how ME/CFS and OI interact to affect CBF is crucial for improving diagnosis and developing targeted therapies.
- **Summary:**
This large-scale review of 118 studies consolidates the evidence that reduced blood flow to the brain is a common feature in both ME/CFS and orthostatic intolerance. The key finding for patients is that having both ME/CFS and OI (like POTS) appears to worsen this blood flow problem significantly. This provides a strong physiological basis for symptoms like brain fog, light-headedness, and post-exertional malaise, especially those triggered by being upright. By establishing reduced CBF as a consistent and measurable abnormality, this work strengthens the case for its use as a potential biomarker for disease severity and points towards future treatments aimed at improving cerebral circulation.
- **Simple Summary:**
A major review of over 100 studies has confirmed that blood flow to the brain is often reduced in people with ME/CFS. This problem is even more significant in patients who also suffer from orthostatic intolerance, like POTS. This finding helps explain symptoms like brain fog and could lead to new ways of monitoring the illness.

### 2025-08-24 Praxisleitfaden Myalgische Enzephalomyelitis / Chronisches Fatigue Syndrom (ME/CFS)
- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Dr. Herbert Renz-Polster, Dr. Monika DrÃ¤ger and the team of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r ME/CFS e. V.
    - **Institutes:** Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r ME/CFS e. V., CharitÃ© Fatigue Centrum der CharitÃ© Berlin.
    - **Publisher:** Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r ME/CFS e. V.
    - **Link:** [Source Document](https://praxisleitfaden.mecfs.de/mecfs)
- **What was researched?**
This document is a comprehensive clinical practice guide for general practitioners on the diagnosis and management of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It synthesizes the current scientific understanding of the disease, including its pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnostic criteria, and therapeutic approaches, with a specific focus on ME/CFS following any trigger, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- **Why was it researched?**
This guide was created to address the significant deficit in medical knowledge and the resulting inadequate care for ME/CFS patients in Germany, where diagnostic delays average 6-7 years. It aims to provide clinicians with an evidence-based, practical tool to correctly diagnose and manage this complex, severe neuroimmunological disease (ICD-10 G93.3), especially given the increasing number of patients since the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10-20% of Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) patients developing ME/CFS.
- **How was it researched?**
This document is a clinical guideline based on a comprehensive review of existing scientific literature, international diagnostic criteria (IOM, CCC), and established medical guidelines (e.g., NICE Guideline 2021). It consolidates expert consensus and evidence into a structured format for practical use in a clinical setting, rather than presenting new primary research from a specific patient cohort. The guide covers pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnostic procedures, symptom management, and socio-medical support.
- **What has been found?**
The guide establishes ME/CFS as a severe, chronic, multi-systemic disease characterized by pathomechanisms including dysregulation of the immune and autonomic nervous systems, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction. The cardinal symptom is Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), a pathological worsening of symptoms after minimal physical, cognitive, or emotional exertion. The guide provides detailed outlines of the multi-faceted symptoms (neurological, immunological, autonomic, neuroendocrine), diagnostic procedures, and common comorbidities such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and Small-Fiber Neuropathy (SFN).
- **Discussion:**
The authors emphasize that ME/CFS is a biological, not a psychogenic, illness and that outdated concepts like Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) are contraindicated and harmful, often leading to severe and permanent deterioration. The guide highlights the immense disease burden, with quality of life often lower than in conditions like MS or stroke, and the significant stigmatization patients face in the healthcare system. The lack of a curative therapy or specific biomarkers is a major limitation, making diagnosis dependent on clinical criteria and exclusion of other conditions.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that management of ME/CFS must be centered on three pillars: 1) Energy management (Pacing) to prevent PEM, 2) symptomatic therapy to alleviate the most burdensome symptoms, and 3) diagnosis and treatment of comorbidities. They recommend several off-label medications for symptom control, including Pyridostigmin ðŸ’Š (MestinonÂ®), Low-Dose Naltrexone ðŸ’Š (LDN), and Low-Dose Aripiprazol ðŸ’Š (LDA). The guide implicitly calls for increased research to identify biomarkers and develop targeted treatments, as well as for improved education and specialized care structures within the healthcare system.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive guide provides German-speaking clinicians with a crucial, evidence-based framework for diagnosing and managing ME/CFS, which could significantly reduce diagnostic delays and prevent harmful treatments for patients. For patients, this document serves as an important validation of their illness as a severe, physical condition and outlines a management approach focused on stabilization and symptom control, particularly the avoidance of Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) through Pacing. The guide's detailed discussion of symptomatic off-label treatments and the management of common comorbidities like POTS and MCAS offers practical pathways for improving patients' quality of life while awaiting the development of curative therapies.
- **Simple Summary:**
A new, detailed guide has been published to help doctors in Germany better understand and diagnose ME/CFS. It confirms that the illness is a serious physical condition and explains that avoiding overexertion is the most important part of management. The guide also gives doctors suggestions for medications that can help manage the complex symptoms of the illness.

    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Neuroscience
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1637838)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the immediate effect of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine on muscle strength and orthostatic function in patients with post-infectious Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is often characterized by muscle weakness and fatiguability. Previous research indicated that pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š improved cardiac output in ME/CFS patients, and the drug is currently used off-label for ME/CFS and POTS. This study aimed to formally evaluate its effects on muscle strength, a key symptom of the illness.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an interventional study involving 20 patients with post-infectious ME/CFS. Researchers measured hand grip strength ten times using an electric dynamometer and repeated the test one hour later to assess fatiguability. In a separate test session, patients received a 30 mg dose of pyridostigmine after the initial measurement, and the test was repeated one hour later to measure the drug's effect. Orthostatic function was also assessed using a passive standing test, and patients were screened to rule out Myasthenia Gravis.
- **What has been found?**
All patients initially showed reduced hand grip strength. Without the drug, strength declined significantly after one hour. In contrast, one hour after taking pyridostigmine, patients showed a median increase of 2.6 kg in maximum hand grip strength. The drug also improved orthostatic function, as shown by a smaller increase in heart rate upon standing (median of 13 bpm with the drug vs. 17 bpm without).
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose that the observed improvements are due to two primary mechanisms. They suggest the drug increases the availability of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, which directly impacts muscle function, and that it also augments parasympathetic tone, which helps regulate autonomic functions like heart rate.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The study concludes that pyridostigmine has an immediate and positive effect on both muscle strength and orthostatic function in ME/CFS patients. The abstract does not specify plans for future work but establishes a clear therapeutic benefit that warrants further investigation.
- **Summary:**
This research provides objective evidence that pyridostigmine, a drug already in use for other conditions, can temporarily improve muscle strength and stabilize heart rate in ME/CFS patients. The findings support a potential role for impaired neuromuscular and autonomic signaling in the disease's symptoms, specifically muscle weakness and orthostatic intolerance. While this was a small-scale study, it validates a pharmacological approach for symptom management and points towards a specific biological mechanism that could be targeted in future treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers found that a drug called pyridostigmine immediately improved hand grip strength in ME/CFS patients. The medicine also helped reduce the heart rate increase that happens when standing up. This study suggests the drug may help with muscle weakness and orthostatic symptoms in the illness.

    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-025-09008-0)
- **What was researched?**
This paper describes the study protocol for RAPID, a large-scale, multicenter adaptive platform trial in Germany designed to evaluate various treatment options for Post Covid Syndrome (PCS). It specifically details the first intervention arm, called RAPID_REVIVE, which will assess the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) ðŸ’Š in improving physical function for patients with PCS.
- **Why was it researched?**
A significant portion of individuals who contract COVID-19 develop long-term symptoms known as PCS, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatment options available. The RAPID trial was established to address this urgent medical need by creating an efficient framework to test promising therapies. The first drug, vidofludimus calcium, was selected because it targets two leading hypotheses for the cause of PCS: persistent SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoirs or reactivation of other viruses like EBV, and the resulting chronic inflammation.
- **How was it researched?**
This document is a study protocol, outlining the methodology of a future clinical trial. RAPID_REVIVE is designed as a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to enroll 376 adults with moderate to severe PCS across 11 hospitals in Germany. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a daily oral dose of vidofludimus calcium or a placebo for a 56-day treatment period, followed by a 28-day follow-up. The primary outcome will be the change in physical function from baseline to day 56, as measured by the Short Form-36 Physical Function (SF-36-PF) questionnaire, with secondary endpoints assessing fatigue, cognitive symptoms, and other quality of life metrics.
- **What has been found?**
As this is a study protocol, it describes the plan for the research rather than its results. No findings have been generated yet. The trial was registered in March 2024, and the protocol indicates that patient recruitment was planned to begin in August 2024 and be completed by June 2025.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight the significant advantages of the adaptive platform trial design. This modern approach is more efficient and flexible than traditional single-drug trials, allowing researchers to evaluate multiple interventions simultaneously, add new treatment arms as they emerge, and adapt the study based on incoming data. This is particularly valuable for a new and complex illness like PCS, where the scientific understanding is evolving rapidly and numerous treatment hypotheses need to be tested.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that the RAPID platform trial is a crucial step toward establishing an evidence base for treating PCS, which currently does not exist. The first arm, RAPID_REVIVE, will investigate a promising antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, addressing core hypotheses of the disease's pathology. In the future, the overarching RAPID platform is designed to incorporate and evaluate additional interventions, aiming to accelerate the identification of effective treatments for this debilitating condition.
- **Summary:**
This paper announces a major, well-designed German clinical trial (RAPID) to test treatments for Post Covid Syndrome, a condition with significant symptom overlap with ME/CFS. The first phase of the trial will test an antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug called vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) to see if it can improve physical function. This drug was chosen because it targets the widely held theory that persistent viral activity and chronic inflammation drive the illness. The trial's innovative "adaptive platform" design allows researchers to test multiple drugs more efficiently and is a significant step forward in the search for the first proven, effective treatments for post-viral diseases like PCS and potentially ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists in Germany have started a large clinical trial to find effective treatments for Post Covid Syndrome. The first drug being tested is an antiviral and anti-inflammatory pill meant to target potential root causes of the illness. This study is designed to be flexible, allowing researchers to test many different potential treatments over time to find what works.

This review article explores how the various underlying biological abnormalities identified in both long COVID and ME/CFS lead to the illnesses' characteristic symptoms and why these symptoms persist for years. The authors propose that in addition to direct causes, symptoms may also arise from the activation of ancient, evolutionarily conserved responses to vital threats, specifically "sickness behavior" and "torpor," which are mediated by specific neural circuits.
- **Why was it researched?**
While many biological abnormalities (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, autoantibodies) have been found in both long COVID and ME/CFS, the precise mechanisms linking these issues to the generation and chronicity of symptoms remain unclear. This review aims to synthesize recent discoveries to explain how these diverse pathologies might converge on a common pathway in the brain, offering a more unified understanding of the diseases.
- **How was it researched?**
This paper is a literature review. The authors synthesized and analyzed findings from numerous existing research articles on long COVID, ME/CFS, immunology, and neuroscience. They used this evidence to construct a comprehensive model explaining how neuroinflammation, triggered by various peripheral abnormalities, could activate specific neural circuits in the brain to produce a stereotyped set of sickness symptoms and metabolic changes.
- **What has been found?**
The authors argue that symptoms are caused both directly by various pathologies and indirectly through a central mechanism: neuroinflammation. This neuroinflammation, triggered by factors like persistent viral antigens or gut dysbiosis, is proposed to stimulate newly discovered neural circuits in the brainstem and hypothalamus. These circuits then orchestrate evolutionarily ancient, energy-preserving responses known as "sickness behavior" and a "torpor-like" hypometabolic state, manifesting as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and malaise. The illness becomes chronic due to persistent triggers (like viral reservoirs) and the creation of self-perpetuating "vicious cycles," where different biological abnormalities reinforce one another.
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose that a "single lesion" is unlikely to be the sole cause of these complex illnesses. Their model's strength lies in providing a unifying explanation where diverse peripheral issues converge on a central symptom-generating pathway in the brain. They suggest that while targeting each individual abnormality is a valid therapeutic approach, it may be more effective to target the central driver of neuroinflammation that activates these sickness-mediating neural circuits.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that the symptoms and metabolic changes in long COVID and ME/CFS are likely driven by neuroinflammation activating specific brain circuits that control sickness behavior. The chronicity is maintained by persistent triggers and interlocking "vicious cycles" of pathology. They suggest that future therapeutic strategies should focus on developing novel treatments that can precisely quell neuroinflammation, which may alleviate many of the core symptoms of these illnesses.
- **Summary:**
This review provides a compelling framework that connects the wide range of physical problems found in ME/CFS and Long COVID (such as immune dysfunction, mitochondrial issues, and viral persistence) to a central mechanism in the brain. It proposes that these different issues all contribute to brain inflammation, which in turn activates a primitive "sickness program" responsible for generating core symptoms like profound fatigue and cognitive difficulties. The illness persists because these biological problems create self-sustaining vicious cycles. This model suggests that future treatments aimed at calming brain inflammation could offer a powerful way to manage the symptoms for a broad range of patients.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers propose that the various biological problems in ME/CFS and Long COVID all lead to inflammation in the brain. This brain inflammation is thought to activate an ancient, built-in "sickness mode," which causes the main symptoms like fatigue and brain fog. Understanding this could lead to new treatments that focus on calming brain inflammation to help patients feel better.

### 2025-08-11 Microfluidic assessment of PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity in ME/CFS

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Yaojun Guo, Sitong Zhou, Samuel Ren, Xin Liu, Mohsen Nemat-Gorgani, Mike Gresser, Ronald W. Davis, Jiandi Wan
    - **Institutes:** Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Davis; Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, Medical Center of University of California, Davis; Henry Gunn High School.
    - **Publisher:** blood RCI
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brci.2025.100019)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated how red blood cells (RBCs) from individuals with ME/CFS change their speed in tiny, capillary-like channels in response to varying oxygen levels ($PO_2$). The researchers explored whether these measurements could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS and be used to evaluate the effects of potential therapeutic drugs.
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous research has consistently shown that ME/CFS patients have impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the underlying cause is unclear. Based on prior findings that RBCs actively regulate capillary blood flow in response to local oxygen demand, the researchers hypothesized that RBC function might be compromised in ME/CFS, contributing to these blood flow abnormalities. This study aimed to test that hypothesis by directly measuring RBC behavior under controlled oxygen conditions.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an *ex vivo* laboratory study using microfluidic devices to mimic blood capillaries. The researchers analyzed blood samples from a cohort of 35 ME/CFS patients and 23 healthy controls. They measured the velocity of isolated RBCs as they passed through the micro-channels at four different oxygen tensions ($PO_2$), from normal to hypoxic levels. The resulting data were analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to assess their diagnostic potential. The team also incubated RBCs from ME/CFS patients with two drugs to see if their function could be improved.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that RBCs from ME/CFS patients have an impaired response to low oxygen. While healthy RBCs sped up significantly as oxygen dropped, ME/CFS RBCs showed a much smaller increase in velocity. The "velocity slope," which measures this sensitivity to oxygen changes, was significantly lower in the ME/CFS group and proved to be a robust biomarker. A machine learning model using this slope feature was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (77.8%), sensitivity (76%), and specificity (90%). Additionally, treating ME/CFS RBCs with salmeterol xinafoate ðŸ’Š and xanomeline ðŸ’Š improved their velocity in response to low oxygen in this lab setting.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the impaired RBC response to low oxygen may be caused by known cellular issues in ME/CFS, such as reduced RBC deformability and increased oxidative stress. They highlight that dynamic measurements, like testing the response to a stressor like hypoxia, appear more effective for diagnosis than static measurements. The primary limitation acknowledged in the paper is the relatively small sample size, which necessitates further validation in larger patient cohorts.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that RBCs from ME/CFS patients exhibit significantly impaired capillary velocity in response to reduced oxygen levels, revealing a previously unrecognized role for RBCs in the disease's pathophysiology. This RBC-based microfluidic method presents a novel and potentially effective approach for ME/CFS classification and assessment. The research is ongoing with plans to continue with a larger patient cohort to improve the detection accuracy and ease of use.
- **Summary:**
This research provides a potential physical explanation for the blood flow abnormalities and oxygen delivery problems often reported in ME/CFS. It suggests that the red blood cells themselves are less able to respond to the body's demand for oxygen, which could contribute to symptoms like post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction. The "velocity slope" measurement developed in this study is a promising candidate for a much-needed objective diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS. Furthermore, the *in vitro* success of two existing drugs in correcting this RBC dysfunction offers a new, targeted avenue for the development of future treatments aimed at improving microcirculation, though these findings are preliminary and require much more research.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists found that red blood cells from ME/CFS patients struggle to speed up when oxygen is low, which may help explain blood flow problems. This discovery could be used to develop a new, objective blood test to help diagnose the illness. In the lab, they also showed that two existing drugs helped the cells function better, opening a new direction for future treatment research.

### 2025-08-11 Circulating cell-free RNA signatures for the characterization and diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Anne E. Gardella, Daniel Eweis-LaBolle, Conor J. Loy, Emma D. Belcher, Joan S. Lenz, Carl J. Franconi, Sally Y. Scofield, Andrew Grimson, Maureen R. Hanson, Iwijn De Vlaminck
    - **Institutes:** Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University; Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University.
    - **Publisher:** PNAS
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2507345122)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are small pieces of genetic material released by cells into the bloodstream, could be used as a minimally invasive tool to diagnose ME/CFS and to better understand its underlying biology. The researchers aimed to identify cfRNA patterns specific to ME/CFS and use them to build a diagnostic model.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS lacks clinically validated biomarkers for an objective diagnosis, forcing reliance on subjective symptom evaluation. Previous research has pointed towards immune system dysregulation in the disease, but the biological mechanisms are poorly understood. The researchers explored cfRNA as a promising "liquid biopsy" tool because it can reflect dynamic changes in gene expression and cellular processes throughout the body, and has been successful in diagnosing other complex inflammatory diseases.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a case-control study that analyzed plasma samples from 93 ME/CFS patients and 75 healthy, sedentary controls. The researchers performed RNA sequencing on the cfRNA isolated from the plasma. They then used computational and machine learning methods to identify cfRNA transcripts that were different between the two groups and trained a diagnostic model to distinguish patients from controls. Additionally, they used a bioinformatic deconvolution technique to estimate the cellular origins of the cfRNA signals.
- **What has been found?**
The study identified 743 unique cfRNA features that differed significantly between ME/CFS cases and controls. A machine learning model (GLMNET Lasso) using a signature of 21 cfRNA genes was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with 77% accuracy and a test-set AUC of 0.81. Analysis of the cfRNA's cellular origins revealed significant differences in immune cell contributions, with ME/CFS patients showing elevated cfRNA from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and T cells, but decreased cfRNA from platelets. Pathway analysis further implicated immune dysfunction, highlighting signatures of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammatory signaling in patients.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the diagnostic model's performance varied among individuals, and this variability was correlated with the amount of platelet-derived cfRNA, suggesting a true biological difference in platelet function in ME/CFS. A key limitation of the study is that it only analyzed samples taken at baseline, without provoking symptoms through an exercise challenge. The authors state that future work is needed to validate the findings in larger patient cohorts to account for disease heterogeneity and improve the model's robustness.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that cfRNA analysis is a valuable, minimally invasive tool for investigating the biology of ME/CFS, providing strong evidence for widespread immune dysregulation in the disease. They suggest that future studies should investigate cfRNA dynamics during post-exertional malaise (PEM) to gain further insight. Expanding the cohort size will be crucial for improving the generalizability and accuracy of cfRNA-based biomarkers for ME/CFS diagnosis and characterization.
- **Summary:**
This study introduces a novel blood analysis technique, called RNA liquid biopsy, that identifies distinct patterns of genetic material (cfRNA) in the blood of ME/CFS patients. The findings strongly support the theory of immune system dysregulation, revealing signals of T cell exhaustion, chronic inflammation, and altered activity in monocytes and dendritic cells. By applying machine learning to these cfRNA patterns, the researchers developed a promising, though not yet perfect, model that could distinguish patients from controls with 77% accuracy. This work represents a significant step towards a much-needed objective, blood-based diagnostic test and provides new molecular evidence reinforcing that ME/CFS is a biological illness rooted in the immune system.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists analyzed fragments of genetic material called RNA in the blood and found specific patterns in ME/CFS patients that point to widespread immune system problems. They used these patterns to train a computer model that can identify ME/CFS from a blood sample with promising accuracy, moving us closer to a potential diagnostic test. This research provides new evidence for the biological basis of the illness, particularly involving immune cell dysfunction.

- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether immunoglobulins (specifically IgG antibodies) isolated from the blood of ME/CFS and PASC (Long COVID) patients could directly cause mitochondrial dysfunction in healthy human cells. The researchers examined the effects of these patient-derived IgGs on mitochondrial structure, cellular energy production, and the secretion of inflammatory markers, and also analyzed the composition of proteins bound to the IgGs.
- **Why was it researched?**
Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune system abnormalities are known features of ME/CFS, but the direct cause linking them is not fully understood. Previous research suggested an autoimmune component, as transferring IgG from patients to mice could induce symptoms. This study aimed to test the hypothesis *in vitro* (in a lab dish) that IgG from patients is a direct driver of the mitochondrial and metabolic problems seen in the disease.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an *in vitro* laboratory study using purified IgG antibodies from the blood serum of ME/CFS patients (n=40), PASC patients (n=16), multiple sclerosis patients (n=11), and healthy controls (n=39). The researchers exposed healthy human endothelial cells (HUVECs) to these IgGs and used microscopy to observe changes in mitochondrial structure. They measured cellular energy metabolism using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer and also exposed healthy immune cells (PBMCs) to the IgGs to measure inflammatory cytokine release. Finally, they used mass spectrometry to identify the proteins that were bound to the patient IgGs, a technique called immune complex proteomics.
- **What has been found?**
IgG from a subgroup of ME/CFS and PASC patients caused significant fragmentation of mitochondria in healthy endothelial cells, an effect that was more pronounced with IgG from female patients. While intact IgG was required for fragmentation, its separated 'Fab' fragment alone could alter cellular energy production by increasing maximal respiration, indicating cellular stress. In contrast, the 'Fc' fragment induced a hypometabolic state. Proteomic analysis revealed that ME/CFS immune complexes were enriched with proteins related to extracellular matrix organization, whereas PASC immune complexes were linked to hemostasis (blood clotting regulation).
- **Discussion:**
The authors note the complexity of the findings, where different parts of the IgG molecule (Fab vs. Fc) have distinct effects on cellular energy, and the intact molecule is needed to cause mitochondrial fragmentation. They discuss that the entry of IgG into endothelial cells is a key step, likely mediated by Fc receptors and other non-specific pathways, which could be a pathogenic mechanism in ME/CFS. The distinct protein signatures found in the immune complexes of ME/CFS versus PASC suggest that while the conditions may share symptoms, they may be driven by different underlying biological processes.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The study concludes that IgG from ME/CFS and PASC patients can directly cause mitochondrial fragmentation and metabolic dysregulation in healthy cells, providing a potential pathogenic mechanism for these diseases. The differing protein compositions of immune complexes in ME/CFS and PASC may serve as disease-specific biomarkers. The authors suggest these findings support targeting antibody-mediated pathology as a potential therapeutic strategy for post-infectious illnesses.
- **Summary:**
This study provides direct laboratory evidence that antibodies (IgG) from ME/CFS patients can damage the mitochondriaâ€”the energy factoriesâ€”of healthy cells. This reinforces the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease and offers a potential biological explanation for the profound energy impairment experienced by patients. The research also uncovered key differences between ME/CFS and Long COVID (PASC) at a molecular level; ME/CFS appears linked to issues with the structural support around cells (extracellular matrix), while PASC is more associated with blood clotting pathways. These findings could pave the way for developing more specific diagnostic tests and treatments aimed at correcting these antibody-driven problems.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists showed in the lab that antibodies from ME/CFS patients can damage the energy-producing parts of healthy cells. This research helps explain why energy production is a problem in ME/CFS and points to it being an autoimmune disease. The study also found distinct molecular differences between ME/CFS and Long COVID, which may lead to better tests and treatments in the future.

    - **Publisher:** International Journal of Molecular Sciences
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26167670)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the levels of a stress-responsive metabolic hormone called Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) in the blood of patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), Fibromyalgia (FM), and both conditions (ME+FM). The researchers aimed to determine if FGF-21 levels could serve as a biomarker to identify distinct patient subgroups based on their specific symptom patterns and cognitive function.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME and FM lack objective biomarkers, which complicates diagnosis, treatment, and research. Since FGF-21 is linked to metabolic dysfunction and mitochondrial stressâ€”processes thought to be involved in these illnessesâ€”it was considered a promising candidate biomarker. Previous smaller studies yielded inconsistent results, necessitating this larger, more comprehensive investigation to clarify FGF-21's role and its potential for stratifying patients into more precise clinical subtypes.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a cross-sectional study involving 250 patients (99 with ME, 47 with FM, 104 with ME+FM) and 54 healthy controls. Diagnoses were confirmed using a validated microRNA panel. Researchers measured plasma FGF-21 levels and categorized all participants into low, normal, or high FGF-21 groups. Symptom severity and cognitive function were assessed using validated questionnaires (DSQ, DPEMQ, SF-36, MFI-20) and the BrainCheck cognitive testing platform, with PEM being assessed after a standardized mechanical provocation test.
- **What has been found?**
Plasma FGF-21 levels were significantly elevated in patients with ME and ME+FM compared to healthy controls, but not in those with FM alone. More importantly, stratifying patients by their FGF-21 levels revealed distinct clinical profiles that varied by diagnosis. Low FGF-21 levels were associated with more severe PEM and immune/autonomic symptoms in ME patients and with poorer mental health in ME+FM patients. Conversely, high FGF-21 levels correlated with better cognitive performance in the ME group, but with worse physical fatigue in the ME+FM group.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight that the study's main strength is its large, well-characterized cohort and the stratification by FGF-21 levels, which revealed complex, phenotype-specific correlations. High FGF-21 may represent a protective compensatory mechanism in some ME patients, but could indicate systemic overload or hormone resistance in ME+FM patients. A key limitation is the cross-sectional design, which cannot establish causality. The study also noted discrepancies between self-reported and provocation-based PEM assessments, underscoring the need for objective PEM measurement tools.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that circulating FGF-21 is a nuanced and promising biomarker for ME and FM, capable of stratifying patients into subgroups with distinct symptom and cognitive profiles. This finding supports a move towards personalized medicine by identifying patients who might benefit from different therapeutic strategies. The authors call for future longitudinal studies and clinical trials to validate these subgroups and to test whether modulating FGF-21 signaling can improve patient outcomes.
- **Summary:**
This research identifies the hormone FGF-21 as a potential key for unlocking the biological differences between subgroups of ME and FM patients. The study suggests that both abnormally low and abnormally high levels of FGF-21 are linked to specific symptom patterns, but these links change depending on whether a patient has ME, FM, or both. For example, high FGF-21 was associated with better cognition in ME-only patients but worse physical fatigue in those with both ME and FM. This work provides a framework for classifying patients beyond simple diagnostic labels, which could lead to personalized treatments. The authors discuss several potential therapies to either boost low FGF-21 levels with drugs like metformin ðŸ’Š or FGF-21 analogues like efruxifermin ðŸ’Š, or to address hormone resistance in high-FGF-21 states with agents like PPARy agonists ðŸ’Š or senolytics ðŸ’Š.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers studied a hormone called FGF-21 and found that its level in the blood is linked to different symptom patterns in ME and Fibromyalgia. This finding helps to classify patients into more specific biological subgroups. Understanding these subgroups is an important step towards developing personalized treatments in the future.

### 2025-08-06 Initial findings from the DecodeME genome-wide association study of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** DecodeME Collaboration
    - **Institutes:** MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh; Pain Service, NHS Tayside, Ninewells Hospital; c/o DecodeME, MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh.
    - **Publisher:** Preprint
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.06.25333109)
- **What was researched?**
This study aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). By conducting a large genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers compared the DNA of thousands of ME/CFS patients with a large population of healthy controls to find genetic risk factors that could point to the underlying biological mechanisms of the disease.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a common, disabling illness with no known cause, diagnostic test, or effective treatments. Previous genetic studies have been too small to produce robust and replicable findings. Identifying genetic risk factors is a high research priority for patients and is considered a critical step toward developing diagnostics and effective therapies.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) co-produced by scientists and people with ME/CFS. The study recruited participants from the UK, collecting DNA from saliva samples. The final analysis compared the DNA of 15,579 ME/CFS cases of European ancestry against 259,909 healthy controls from the UK Biobank, using stringent case criteria that required a professional diagnosis and the presence of post-exertional malaise.
- **What has been found?**
The study discovered eight distinct genetic loci (regions in the genome) that are significantly associated with ME/CFS. Three of these loci are located near genes involved in the immune response to infection (BTN2A2, OLFM4, and RABGAP1L). One locus, near the gene CA10, shares a common genetic signal with multisite chronic pain. Importantly, the study found no evidence that these genetic risk factors for ME/CFS are shared with depression or anxiety.
- **Discussion:**
The authors attribute the study's success to its high statistical power, achieved through its large size, and its use of stringent case-definition criteria requiring post-exertional malaise. They note that the findings were not replicated in other large biobank analyses, which they suggest could be due to differences in how cases were defined in those cohorts (i.e., not strictly requiring ME/CFS's hallmark symptom). The study was limited to common genetic variants in people of European ancestry, and the authors state the need for further research in more diverse populations and for rarer genetic variants.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that this study provides the first robust evidence that common genetic variation contributes to the risk of developing ME/CFS, indicating that both immunological and neurological processes are involved in its pathology. These findings provide a firm biological foundation for ME/CFS research, which should help reduce stigma and accelerate the search for treatments. Future work will include analyzing DNA from all genetic ancestries, fine-mapping the identified genetic regions, and sequencing whole genomes to search for rare variants.
- **Summary:**
This landmark study, the largest of its kind for ME/CFS, provides the first strong scientific evidence that the illness has a clear biological basis rooted in genetics. The findings link ME/CFS risk to specific genes involved in the immune system's response to infection and genes active in the brain, aligning with the common patient experience of post-viral onset and neurological symptoms like pain and brain fog. By identifying a genetic link to chronic pain but not to depression, this research offers crucial biological evidence that distinguishes ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions. This provides a vital foundation for future research to develop objective diagnostic markers and targeted treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
The largest ever genetic study of ME/CFS found eight specific differences in the DNA of patients compared to healthy people. These results strongly suggest the illness is a real biological disease involving both the immune system and the brain. This is a major step forward, providing a solid basis for future research into what causes the illness and how to diagnose and treat it.

### 2025-08-06 Genetic depletion of early autophagy protein ATG13 impairs mitochondrial energy metabolism, augments oxidative stress, induces the polarization of macrophages to M1 inflammatory mode, and compromises myelin integrity in skeletal muscle

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Mubaraq A. Toriola, Emma Timlin, Sarojini Bulbule, Amy Reyes, Omolola Mary Adedeji, C. Gunnar Gottschalk, Animesh Barua, Leggy A. Arnold, Avik Roy
    - **Institutes:** University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; Simmaron Research INC.
    - **Publisher:** Research Square
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7189456/v1)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the molecular consequences of genetically reducing ATG13, a key protein involved in autophagy (the cell's quality control and recycling system). Using a mouse model, researchers explored how this depletion affects mitochondrial energy metabolism, inflammation in immune cells called macrophages, and the health of nerves within skeletal muscle, particularly in the context of post-exertional malaise (PEM).
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous research showed that disrupting the *atg13* gene in mice led to muscle weakness and nerve damage, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Given that ME/CFS is characterized by PEM, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune abnormalities, the researchers hypothesized that studying the effects of ATG13 depletion could provide a relevant animal model to better understand the molecular basis of the disease.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a preclinical study using a genetically engineered mouse model with a partial deletion of the *atg13* gene ($Tg^{+/-ATG13}$). Researchers compared these mice to normal mice by isolating macrophages from their spleens and analyzing them with multiple lab techniques. They used seahorse assays to measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis, flow cytometry to determine the polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) types, and immunofluorescence to visualize proteins in tissue. Muscle function and fatigue were assessed using open-field behavioral tests and EMG recordings before and after a treadmill exercise challenge.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that reducing ATG13 impaired autophagy, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages, characterized by reduced ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). This metabolic defect caused the macrophages to shift to a pro-inflammatory M1 state. These inflammatory M1 macrophages were found to infiltrate the blood vessels in skeletal muscle, which was associated with damage to the myelin sheath of muscle-serving nerves. Critically, these energy metabolism deficits and the resulting muscle weakness were significantly exacerbated following a treadmill exercise challenge, mirroring the PEM experienced by patients.
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose a novel mechanism where impaired autophagy, caused by ATG13 depletion, triggers a cascade of pathological events relevant to ME/CFS. They suggest that the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress lead to reduced activity of the deacetylase enzyme SIRT1, which in turn promotes a pro-inflammatory state via activation of NF-ÎºB. This model connects the dots between a fundamental cellular process (autophagy), immune cell dysfunction (M1 polarization), and key symptoms like muscle fatigue and PEM.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that the genetic depletion of ATG13 creates a robust model for inflammation-driven muscle fatigue, linking impaired autophagy to mitochondrial deficits, M1 macrophage polarization, and nerve demyelination. Their future work will involve studying M1/M2 polarization in immune cells derived from ME/CFS patients participating in a clinical trial of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ðŸ’Š, aiming to translate these findings from the mouse model to human patients.
- **Summary:**
This research provides a potential biological mechanism that connects impaired cellular "housekeeping" (autophagy) to the mitochondrial dysfunction, immune activation, and post-exertional malaise seen in ME/CFS. By using a mouse model, the study demonstrates how a single genetic defect can cause immune cells to become inflammatory, leading them to infiltrate muscles, damage local nerves, and cause profound weakness that worsens after exertion. This work strengthens the evidence for the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial health in ME/CFS and suggests that targeting these pathways could be a future therapeutic strategy.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists studied mice with a genetic defect in a cellular 'housekeeping' process, causing issues similar to those in ME/CFS. This defect made their immune cells inflammatory, leading to nerve damage in the muscles and severe fatigue. The mice's symptoms, especially fatigue and weakness, got much worse after exercise, providing a model to understand post-exertional malaise.

This Phase II controlled trial investigated if Heart Rate Variability-Biofeedback (HRV-BF), a non-pharmacological intervention, is a feasible and potentially effective therapy for individuals with Long COVID who meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The study's primary goals were to assess feasibility through dropout rates and patient satisfaction, and to measure preliminary changes in symptoms like fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain.
- **Why was it researched?**
The symptoms of Long COVID frequently overlap with those of ME/CFS, a condition for which there are no proven effective treatments. This has created an urgent need for new, safe, and integrative management strategies. Researchers hypothesized that HRV-BF, a technique aimed at improving self-regulation of the nervous system, could be a practical and acceptable intervention to help manage the complex symptom burden in this patient population.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a small, controlled feasibility study involving 18 participants with Long COVID and ME/CFS. The participants were assigned to one of two groups: an intervention group that received 10 sessions of HRV-BF over five weeks in addition to their usual medical care, or a control group that only received usual care. The HRV-BF sessions involved using real-time feedback on heart rate to learn controlled breathing patterns. Researchers used standardized questionnaires to measure fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life before and after the intervention period.
- **What has been found?**
The study demonstrated that HRV-BF is a highly feasible and well-tolerated intervention, with a very low dropout rate (5.56%) and high participant satisfaction. The main finding was a statistically significant improvement in severe fatigue in the HRV-BF group compared to the control group. While improvements in other individual symptoms like anxiety, depression, and pain were not statistically significant, an overall trend of positive changes was observed across all measures in the group that received the intervention.
- **Discussion:**
The authors emphasize that as a small, preliminary Phase II study, the findings are not definitive proof of clinical efficacy and should be interpreted with caution. The study's main limitation is its small sample size, which increases the possibility of the results being due to chance. However, a key strength highlighted is the excellent feasibility of the intervention, demonstrated by an exceptionally low dropout rate compared to other non-pharmacological therapies studied in ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that HRV-BF is a feasible, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for people with ME/CFS following Long COVID. The promising preliminary results, particularly for reducing fatigue, strongly support the need for larger, more definitive Phase III clinical trials. Future research should aim to confirm these benefits and investigate the intervention's potential effects on the broader spectrum of ME/CFS and Long COVID symptoms.
- **Summary:**
This research explores a non-drug, self-regulation technique called HRV-Biofeedback as a potential management tool for ME/CFS symptoms that arise after a COVID-19 infection. The study's most important finding is a significant reduction in severe fatigue, a core symptom of the illness, which is noteworthy given the lack of proven treatments. Critically, the intervention proved to be very practical and acceptable to patients, with almost no one dropping out, in stark contrast to more controversial interventions previously studied. While this is an early-stage study that does not provide a definitive treatment, it offers strong justification for larger trials and presents a potential new direction for a safe, empowering symptom management tool.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a mind-body technique using breathing and heart rate feedback to help people with ME/CFS after Long COVID. The study found the technique was safe and practical, and it significantly reduced severe fatigue in the small group of patients who used it. These positive early results mean larger studies are now justified to confirm if this could become a helpful tool for managing symptoms.

### 2025-07-28 Biomarkers over Time: From Visual Contrast Sensitivity to Transcriptomics in Differentiating Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ming Dooley
    - **Institutes:** Holistic Resonance Center, San Diego, CA, USA
    - **Publisher:** International Journal of Molecular Sciences
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26157284)
- **What was researched?**
This review paper provides a chronological history of the development of biomarkers used to diagnose Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). It traces the evolution from early functional tests, like visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), to advanced genomic profiling, aiming to establish a clear diagnostic framework that can differentiate CIRS from ME/CFS.
- **Why was it researched?**
CIRS and ME/CFS share debilitating and overlapping symptoms, often leading to misdiagnosis. However, ME/CFS lacks validated biomarkers and a reproducible diagnostic model, whereas CIRS is defined by a consistent pattern of immune dysregulation linked to environmental biotoxin exposure. The author suggests that many patients diagnosed with ME/CFS may actually have unrecognized and treatable CIRS, necessitating a clearer method for differential diagnosis.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that synthesizes peer-reviewed studies, clinical trials, and case reports spanning more than two decades. The author chronologically organizes the integration of CIRS biomarkers, starting with early functional and screening tests and progressing through neuroendocrine, immunologic, volumetric brain imaging, and ultimately transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression: Inflammation Explained (GENIE) platform.
- **What has been found?**
The review demonstrates that CIRS has a structured, reproducible diagnostic model supported by a specific constellation of biomarkers, including low MSH, elevated MMP-9 and TGF-Î²1, and distinct brain volume changes on NeuroQuant MRI. The development of the GENIE transcriptomic test has further refined diagnosis by identifying a core pattern of "molecular hypometabolism" and even suggesting specific environmental triggers like Actinobacteria. The paper highlights that protocol-based treatments, such as cholestyramine (CSM) ðŸ’Š and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) ðŸ’Š, have been shown to normalize these objective markers and resolve symptoms.
- **Discussion:**
The author emphasizes the key distinction between the two illnesses: CIRS has a structured case definition, a reproducible biomarker panel, and measurable responses to targeted therapy. In contrast, ME/CFS is described as a heterogeneous condition with inconsistent case definitions, elusive biomarkers, and primarily symptomatic treatments that do not reverse the underlying pathophysiology. This diagnostic precision in CIRS offers a potential explanation for a subset of patients currently classified under the broader ME/CFS umbrella.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The author concludes that the CIRS framework represents a validated model of an environmentally acquired illness that is responsive to treatment and aligned with precision medicine. Future research should focus on evaluating ME/CFS patients for CIRS to see if they might benefit from its established diagnostic and treatment protocols. The paper suggests the structured, biomarker-guided approach used for CIRS could serve as a model for unraveling other complex, multi-system chronic illnesses.
- **Summary:**
This review provides a comprehensive history of the diagnostic tools developed for Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), an illness triggered by environmental biotoxins from sources like water-damaged buildings. It strongly contrasts the precise, evidence-based diagnostic pathway for CIRS with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding ME/CFS, despite their similar symptom presentations. The paper makes a compelling case that many individuals diagnosed with ME/CFS may instead have treatable CIRS, which can be identified through a specific panel of blood tests, vision screening, brain imaging, and advanced gene expression analysis. By demonstrating that CIRS biomarkers normalize with targeted therapies, this work offers a potential path to an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment for a subset of patients struggling with chronic, unexplained illness.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists reviewed over two decades of research on an illness called CIRS, which is caused by environmental toxins like mold and often mistaken for ME/CFS. They found that CIRS has a reliable set of biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis and to track recovery from treatment. This work provides a clear roadmap for doctors to identify this treatable condition, potentially helping many people who were previously diagnosed with ME/CFS.

### 2025-07-25 AI-driven multi-omics modeling of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ruoyun Xiong, Elizabeth Aiken, Ryan Caldwell, Suzanne D. Vernon, Lina Kozhaya, Courtney Gunter, Lucinda Bateman, Derya Unutmaz, Julia Oh
    - **Institutes:** Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; The University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA; The Jackson Laboratory, Farmington, CT, USA.
    - **Publisher:** nature medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03788-3)
- **What was researched?**
This study developed and applied a deep neural network, named BioMapAI, to a large longitudinal, multi-omics dataset from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. The objective was to integrate diverse biological dataâ€”including gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, and immune profilingâ€”to predict clinical symptom severity, identify specific biomarkers, and create a comprehensive map of the biological interactions underlying the disease.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a complex illness with highly variable symptoms, which makes diagnosis and treatment challenging. Previous studies often focused on identifying one or two key disease indicators, an approach that fails to capture the multifaceted nature of the condition. This research was motivated by the need for methods that can link a wide range of biological data types to the complex matrix of patient-specific symptoms, enabling a more personalized understanding of the disease.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a 4-year longitudinal study that collected data from a cohort of 153 ME/CFS patients and 96 healthy controls. The researchers gathered multiple data types: gut microbiome sequencing, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiling, standard blood lab results, and detailed clinical questionnaires. They used this extensive dataset to train BioMapAI, an explainable AI model, to map the biological profiles to 12 core clinical symptom scores. The model's ability to classify ME/CFS was validated using both held-out data from the cohort and four independent, external patient datasets.
- **What has been found?**
The BioMapAI model successfully classified ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (91% AUC). The study identified both disease-specific biomarkers (consistent across most symptoms) and, more uniquely, symptom-specific biomarkers. Key findings include altered associations in ME/CFS between gut microbial metabolism (e.g., of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, BCAAs, and tryptophan) and a heightened inflammatory response from specific T cell subsets (MAIT and $\gamma\delta$T cells). These disruptions in the microbe-immune network were strongly correlated with the severity of symptoms like fatigue, pain, gastrointestinal issues, and sleep disturbances.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations, including that the model was not tested for its ability to differentiate ME/CFS from other conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as fibromyalgia. The study cohort was from a single geographic location and predominantly white, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the 4-year study period may not be sufficient to capture the full, often decades-long, nonlinear progression of ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that their AI-driven, multi-omics approach provides unprecedented systems-level insights into ME/CFS, refining existing hypotheses and generating new ones about the disrupted connections between the microbiome, metabolome, and immune system. While the findings are not yet ready for direct therapeutic application, they offer numerous avenues for future mechanistic studies. The researchers suggest future work should include longer follow-up periods and incorporate other data types, like host RNA sequencing, to further unravel the disease's complexity.
- **Summary:**
This study introduces a powerful AI tool that integrates vast amounts of biological data from the gut, blood, and immune system to create a more comprehensive and personalized picture of ME/CFS. By connecting specific biological abnormalities to individual symptoms, it moves beyond a simple "sick vs. healthy" comparison and begins to explain the disease's profound variability. The findings reinforce that ME/CFS involves a significant breakdown in the communication between the gut microbiome and the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation that correlates with symptom severity. This approach provides a new framework for discovering more precise biomarkers and generating targeted hypotheses for future treatment research.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers used an advanced AI to analyze complex biological data from patients' gut, blood, and immune systems. The AI found specific biological patterns linked to different ME/CFS symptoms, helping to explain why the illness varies so much between individuals. These findings point to a breakdown in communication between the gut and the immune system, which could be a key driver of the disease and offers new directions for research.

### 2025-07-18 REGAIN: a randomized controlled clinical trial of oxaloacetate for improving the symptoms of long COVID
- **Metadata:**

    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Neuroscience
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1627462)
- **What was researched?**
This randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial evaluated whether a daily oral dose of oxaloacetate (OAA) ðŸ’Š could effectively and safely improve fatigue and cognitive function in adults diagnosed with long COVID. The study's primary goal was to measure the reduction in fatigue over a 42-day period.
- **Why was it researched?**
Long COVID is a persistent and often disabling condition with no widely accepted treatments available. Emerging research suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and altered metabolism may contribute to its symptoms. As oxaloacetate is a key intermediate in cellular energy production and has shown promise in previous trials for reducing fatigue in ME/CFS and long COVID, this study aimed to rigorously test its efficacy.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial involving 69 adults with long COVID. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2,000 mg/day of oxaloacetate or a placebo (rice flour) for 42 days. The primary outcome was fatigue, measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), while secondary outcomes included symptom burden (DSQ-SF), quality of life (RAND-36), objective cognitive function (DANA Brain Vital), and physical activity (UP Time).
- **What has been found?**
The study did not find a statistically significant difference in fatigue reduction between the oxaloacetate and placebo groups based on the primary measure (CFQ). However, the group taking OAA showed significantly greater improvements in both fatigue and total symptom burden at day 21 when measured by a different questionnaire (DSQ-SF). Furthermore, the OAA group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in objective measures of cognitive function, and these cognitive gains were strongly correlated with symptom reduction. The treatment was well tolerated.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the primary outcome measure, the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), may have lacked the sensitivity to detect treatment effects in the complex long COVID population. They suggest that other multi-domain questionnaires, like the DSQ-SF, might be more appropriate for capturing clinically meaningful changes. Key limitations of the study include its modest sample size, the short 42-day duration which may not have been long enough to observe changes in physical function, and its single-site design.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that although the primary endpoint for fatigue was not met, the positive results from secondary measures provide evidence that oxaloacetate may offer clinically meaningful benefits for improving overall symptom burden and cognitive function in individuals with long COVID. The findings support the need for larger, longer-duration trials using a range of sensitive outcome measures to confirm the efficacy of OAA and to better understand its mechanisms of action.
- **Summary:**
This study investigated oxaloacetate, a supplement involved in cellular energy production, as a potential treatment for long COVID. While it failed to significantly improve fatigue according to the main questionnaire, it showed promising results on other fronts. Participants taking oxaloacetate experienced a more rapid reduction in their overall symptom burden and, importantly, showed significant improvements on objective tests of cognitive function, or "brain fog." These cognitive improvements were linked to their symptom improvements, suggesting a real biological effect. Although preliminary, this research highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for addressing the debilitating cognitive deficits in long COVID, warranting further investigation in larger studies.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a supplement called oxaloacetate to see if it could help people with long COVID. The main goal for reducing fatigue wasn't met, but the supplement did lead to faster improvements in overall symptoms. Most importantly, it significantly improved "brain fog" as measured by objective cognitive tests, offering a potential new direction for future treatment research.

### 2025-07-15 Two neurocognitive domains identified for patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ariadna Sandoval, Mingqi Li, Leonard A. Jason
    - **Institutes:** Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States.
    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Neurology
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2025.1612548)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the structure of self-reported neurocognitive symptoms in large groups of patients with ME/CFS and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Researchers aimed to determine if symptoms like sensory hypersensitivity, which are often overlooked, group together with more classic "brain fog" symptoms like memory and concentration problems, or if they form a separate category.
- **Why was it researched?**
While memory and concentration problems are well-recognized neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS and PASC, sensory issues like hypersensitivity to light and noise have been less formally studied as part of this symptom cluster. Some diagnostic criteria, like the Canadian Consensus Criteria, include these sensory disturbances. This research was prompted by the need to statistically evaluate whether these sensory symptoms constitute a distinct domain of neurocognitive impairment in these post-viral illnesses.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a patient data analysis study using self-report surveys. The researchers aggregated data from 2,313 patients with ME/CFS and 299 patients with PASC who had completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ-1). They then used a statistical method called exploratory factor analysis on 13 neurocognitive symptom items from the questionnaire to identify underlying patterns and group related symptoms into distinct "factors" for each illness group.
- **What has been found?**
The analysis revealed a similar two-factor structure for both the ME/CFS and PASC groups. The first factor consisted of classic cognitive symptoms such as problems with memory, slowness of thought, and difficulty paying attention. The second, distinct factor consisted of sensory and perceptual disturbances, including sensitivity to light, noise, and smells. The study also found that patients who reported more severe functional impairment scored significantly worse on both of these neurocognitive factors.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note several limitations, including the reliance on self-reported diagnoses and symptoms rather than clinical confirmation, and the unequal sample sizes between the ME/CFS and PASC groups. They suggest the two identified factors may correspond to dysfunction in different brain networks, with the memory/concentration factor relating to the Central Executive Network and the sensory factor relating to overactivation of the Salience Network. The influence of comorbid conditions on these networks was acknowledged as a complex area for future study.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that the neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS and PASC can be classified into two distinct domains: one related to memory and concentration, and another related to sensory overload. These findings suggest that research and clinical assessment should expand beyond traditional cognitive complaints to include sensory disturbances as a core feature. Future research should aim to connect these self-reported symptom domains with objective biological measures and further explore the underlying brain network abnormalities.
- **Summary:**
This study provides statistical evidence that the "brain fog" experienced by patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID is not a single entity, but is composed of at least two distinct types of problems: traditional cognitive difficulties (memory, focus) and sensory overload (hypersensitivity to light, noise, smells). By formally identifying sensory issues as a separate but core component of neurocognitive impairment, this research validates a key aspect of the patient experience. This framework could improve diagnostic criteria, allow for more precise symptom tracking in clinical trials, and guide researchers to investigate specific brain networks, like the Salience Network, as potential targets for future treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed patient surveys and confirmed that "brain fog" has two main parts: memory and concentration problems, and a separate issue of sensory overload like sensitivity to light and sound. This finding helps validate that sensory problems are a core part of the illness, not just a minor symptom. This better understanding can help guide future research into what goes wrong in the brain and how to treat it.

### 2025-07-09 Plasma cell targeting with the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome-a clinical pilot study

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Ã˜ystein Fluge, Ingrid Gurvin Rekeland, Kari SÃ¸rland, Kine Alme, Kristin Risa, Ove Bruland, Karl Johan Tronstad, Olav Mella
    - **Institutes:** The Cancer Clinic, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway; Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway; Department of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.
    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2025.1607353)
- **What was researched?**
This clinical pilot study investigated the safety and feasibility of using the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab ðŸ’Š to target and deplete plasma cells in patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. The researchers also assessed whether this treatment could lead to clinical improvement over a 12 to 24-month follow-up period.
- **Why was it researched?**
The study was based on the hypothesis that ME/CFS is an autoimmune condition driven by functional autoantibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells. Previous trials using the B-cell depleting drug rituximab failed to show a difference from placebo, which the researchers speculate is because rituximab does not affect these long-lived plasma cells. This study aimed to test if directly targeting these antibody-producing cells with daratumumab could be a more effective strategy.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a prospective, open-label pilot trial involving ten female patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. After a 12-week observation period, all patients received injections of daratumumab; six patients received four injections and four patients received a total of seven injections. Clinical outcomes were measured using self-reported questionnaires (SF-36 Physical Function and DSQ-SF), physical activity trackers (Fitbit), and laboratory tests, including immunoglobulin (IgG) and Natural Killer (NK) cell counts.
- **What has been found?**
The treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Six out of the ten patients experienced marked and sustained clinical improvement, with five of them reaching a physical function score close to or within the normal population range by the end of the follow-up. For the six responders, the average physical function score (SF-36 PF) increased from 32.2 to 78.3. The study also found a significant correlation between a higher baseline NK-cell count and a positive clinical response.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the main limitations of the study are the small number of participants (10), the inclusion of only female patients, and the open-label design, which lacks a placebo control group. They suggest the observed association between higher baseline NK-cell counts and clinical improvement may be biologically significant, as NK cells are involved in the drug's mechanism of depleting plasma cells. The dichotomous response patternâ€”either pronounced improvement or no change at allâ€”was a notable observation.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that targeting plasma cells with daratumumab was feasible, safe, and associated with major and durable symptom improvement in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that functional autoantibodies from long-lived plasma cells play a key role in the disease. A larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was launched in June 2025 to confirm these promising results.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong preliminary evidence for the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease driven by autoantibodies. By using a drug that targets the specific immune cells responsible for long-term antibody production, researchers observed significant, life-altering improvements in a majority of the trial participants. The finding that a higher baseline count of Natural Killer (NK) cells was associated with a better outcome could potentially lead to a biomarker to predict who would benefit from this type of treatment. While these results from a small, open-label trial are very encouraging, they must be confirmed in the larger, placebo-controlled trial that is now underway before any definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy can be made.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a drug that targets specific immune cells suspected of causing ME/CFS, based on the theory that it is an autoimmune illness. In this small, initial study of ten women, six experienced significant and lasting improvements in their health. These hopeful results are a promising first step, and a larger, more rigorous study has now begun to verify if the treatment is truly effective.

### 2025-07-08 Patient-reported treatment outcomes in ME/CFS and long COVID

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Martha Eckey, Peng Li, Braxton Morrison, Jonas Bergquist, Ronald W. Davis, Wenzhong Xiao
    - **Institutes:** Computational Research Center for Complex Chronic Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School; The Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Collaborative Research Centre, Department of Chemistry BMC, Uppsala University; Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Collaborative Research Center, Stanford University School of Medicine.
    - **Publisher:** PNAS
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426874122)
- **What was researched?**
This study analyzed patient-reported outcomes from a large survey of 3,925 individuals to assess the perceived effectiveness of more than 150 different treatments for ME/CFS and long COVID. The research also explored the relationships between patient demographics, symptom profiles, comorbidities, and their responses to these interventions.
- **Why was it researched?**
With no FDA-approved treatments for either ME/CFS or long COVID, patients rely on off-label and palliative therapies. This study was conducted to gather real-world evidence from patient experiences, aiming to identify potentially effective management strategies, highlight symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between the two conditions, and help generate new avenues for future clinical trials.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a patient-reported outcomes study based on data from the online "TREATME" survey. The researchers collected responses from 3,925 patients (2,125 with ME/CFS and 1,800 with long COVID) regarding their symptoms, comorbidities, and perceived effectiveness of various treatments. A "Net Assessment Score" (NAS) was calculated to quantify the benefit of each intervention, and clustering analysis was used to identify patient subgroups based on their unique symptom profiles.
- **What has been found?**
The study revealed a strong correlation ($R^{2}=0.68$) in treatment responses between ME/CFS and long COVID patients, who also shared similar core symptoms like PEM and fatigue. The interventions with the greatest perceived benefits included pacing, fluids/electrolytes ðŸ’Š, compression stockings, low-dose naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š, antihistamines ðŸ’Š, nattokinase/lumbrokinase ðŸ’Š, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IgG) ðŸ’Š. Four distinct patient subgroups with unique symptom profiles (e.g., "POTS-Dominant") were identified, showing varied responses to specific treatments, such as ADHD stimulants ðŸ’Š being most effective in the "Cognitive and Sleep Dysfunction" cluster. Graded exercise therapy (GET) was overwhelmingly reported as harmful.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the study's findings support the use of large-scale patient surveys for gathering real-world evidence. They acknowledge several limitations, including the self-reported nature of the data, potential for sampling and recall bias, the absence of a true placebo control group, and the difficulty of attributing effects when patients use multiple treatments simultaneously. The reliability for some treatments is also limited by a small number of responses.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The researchers conclude that patient-reported data from large surveys provide a valuable foundation of real-world evidence for therapies and can help inform the design of future clinical trials for ME/CFS and long COVID. They suggest future studies could be enhanced by integrating data from health-tracking apps and electronic health records, and by using more targeted surveys to confirm these preliminary findings.
- **Summary:**
This large-scale survey reinforces the significant symptomatic and therapeutic overlap between ME/CFS and long COVID, suggesting they may share underlying disease mechanisms. By analyzing patient experiences, the research identified several widely-used treatmentsâ€”such as pacing, electrolytes, and LDNâ€”that are perceived as highly beneficial, while confirming that graded exercise therapy is seen as harmful. The identification of distinct patient subgroups who respond differently to specific medications supports a move towards personalized medicine and provides a data-driven basis for designing more targeted and effective clinical trials for these complex illnesses.
- **Simple Summary:**
A large survey showed that people with ME/CFS and long COVID have similar symptoms and often benefit from the same treatments. Pacing energy, staying hydrated with electrolytes, and specific medications like low-dose naltrexone were reported as most helpful. This information helps doctors understand what is working for patients and gives researchers better ideas for future studies.

### 2025-07-07 SMPDL3B a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in myalgic encephalomyelitis

    - **Publisher:** Journal of Translational Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-06829-0)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the role of a specific immune-regulatory protein, Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B), in ME/CFS. Researchers aimed to determine if levels of this protein could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and if modulating it could represent a new therapeutic strategy.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a debilitating illness with no objective diagnostic tests or targeted treatments, partly due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying biology. Since immune dysfunction is a known hallmark of the disease, the researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of SMPDL3B, a protein involved in regulating innate immune responses, might contribute to the chronic inflammation and impaired antiviral defenses seen in patients.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a case-control study that analyzed blood samples from two separate groups: a Canadian cohort of 249 ME patients and 63 healthy controls, and a Norwegian replication cohort of 141 ME patients. The researchers used ELISA and flow cytometry to measure the levels of SMPDL3B in the plasma (soluble form) and on the surface of immune cells (membrane-bound form). They also performed *in vitro* experiments on immune cells (PBMCs) to see if existing drugs could correct any abnormalities found.
- **What has been found?**
ME/CFS patients had significantly elevated levels of soluble SMPDL3B in their plasma, and these higher levels correlated with greater symptom severity. In contrast, the amount of SMPDL3B attached to the surface of their immune cells (monocytes) was significantly reduced. This appears to be caused by increased activity of an enzyme called PI-PLC, which cleaves SMPDL3B from the cell membrane. In laboratory experiments, two existing drugs, vildagliptin ðŸ’Š and saxagliptin ðŸ’Š, successfully restored the membrane-bound SMPDL3B and reduced the soluble form by inhibiting PI-PLC activity.
- **Discussion:**
The authors suggest that the loss of membrane-bound SMPDL3B, which normally helps to dampen inflammatory signaling (via TLR4), could contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in ME/CFS. This imbalance could also explain previously observed abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The primary limitations noted were the cross-sectional study design, which cannot prove causation, and a significant female predominance in the patient cohorts, which limited robust analysis of sex-specific differences.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that SMPDL3B is a promising biomarker for ME/CFS severity and a potential therapeutic target. The *in vitro* success of vildagliptin and saxagliptin in preserving membrane-bound SMPDL3B suggests a novel treatment strategy for restoring immune balance. The study calls for future clinical trials to evaluate the potential of these drugs to mitigate immune dysfunction and reduce symptoms in ME/CFS patients.
- **Summary:**
This research identifies a specific molecular abnormality in the immune cells of ME/CFS patients that directly correlates with disease severity. It suggests that a key regulatory protein (SMPDL3B) is being improperly cut from the surface of immune cells, leading to increased inflammation. This provides a potential biological explanation for some of the immune dysregulation in the illness and offers a quantifiable biomarker. Most significantly, the study showed in a lab setting that two existing drugs can reverse this process, presenting a clear and targeted new avenue for the development of future treatments that must now be tested in human trials.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists discovered that a protein which helps control inflammation is being cut off from immune cells in people with ME/CFS, and this is linked to more severe symptoms. This finding could lead to a new blood test to help measure the severity of the illness. In the lab, two existing drugs were able to stop the protein from being cut off, offering a new direction for future treatment research.

- **What was researched?**
This paper summarizes the key findings from the 5th International Symposium on Regulatory Autoantibodies Targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (RAB-GPCRs). It reviews the current understanding of how these autoantibodies function as active modulators in various diseases, including Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), and explores their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
- **Why was it researched?**
This research was motivated by the growing evidence that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are not merely passive disease markers but are active contributors to pathophysiology by altering cellular signaling. The symposium aimed to bring together experts from immunology, neurology, and rheumatology to consolidate knowledge and address the complex role these autoantibodies play in post-viral illnesses like ME/CFS/PCS and other autoimmune conditions.
- **How was it researched?**
This article is a comprehensive review and summary report of the scientific presentations and discussions from an international symposium. It synthesizes findings from recent studies and expert consensus across multiple fields. A key area of focus was a recent study by Hoheisel et al., which investigated the role of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in triggering the production of these autoantibodies in ME/CFS and PCS patients.
- **What has been found?**
The symposium reinforced that functionally active autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are significantly involved in ME/CFS and PCS pathophysiology. A major insight discussed was that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation may be a key trigger, as certain EBV proteins mimic human GPCRs, leading to cross-reactive autoantibodies through molecular mimicry. These autoantibodies were found to be elevated in ME/CFS and PCS patients, correlated with symptom severity, and are believed to contribute directly to symptoms like dysautonomia, fatigue, and pain by disrupting adrenergic receptor signaling. The paper also noted that pathological effects of certain GPCR autoantibodies on blood vessel lining could be reversed by losartan ðŸ’Š in a laboratory setting.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight a paradigm shift in understanding anti-GPCR autoantibodies, now viewing them as dynamic, functionally active agents rather than static biomarkers. They note that these autoantibodies can have a dual nature, acting as either regulatory or pathogenic depending on their concentration, specificity, and the biological context. A primary challenge that remains is to distinguish between their normal regulatory functions and their disease-causing roles to develop them into reliable clinical tools.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are central players in the mechanisms of a wide spectrum of diseases, including ME/CFS. They strongly advocate for future research to adopt integrative, systems-level approaches that combine autoantibody profiles with other biological data (multi-omics). Such approaches are considered essential for decoding the full impact of these autoantibodies and developing novel strategies for diagnosis and precision immunomodulation in chronic diseases.
- **Summary:**
This report consolidates strong evidence that functional autoantibodies attacking the body's own cellular receptors (GPCRs) are a key part of the disease process in ME/CFS and post-COVID conditions. It highlights a compelling theory that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation can trigger the production of these harmful autoantibodies through "molecular mimicry," offering a potential explanation for the autoimmune features of the illness. This mechanism provides a direct biological basis for symptoms like autonomic dysfunction and fatigue, as these autoantibodies can disrupt critical signaling pathways. This line of research is crucial as it paves the way for specific diagnostic markers and targeted treatments aimed at removing or blocking these autoantibodies.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists are increasingly certain that in ME/CFS, the immune system mistakenly creates antibodies that attack the body's own cell receptors. New findings suggest that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may trigger this process by tricking the immune system. This understanding helps explain symptoms and is guiding research toward new diagnostic tests and targeted treatments.

### 2025-06-03 Low Dose Rapamycin Alleviates Clinical Symptoms of Fatigue and PEM in ME/CFS Patients via Improvement of Autophagy
- **Metadata:**

  - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6596158/v1)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the safety and efficacy of low-dose rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, for treating core symptoms of ME/CFS. The researchers also examined whether clinical improvements correlated with changes in blood-based biomarkers related to autophagy, a cellular self-cleaning process.
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous research from the authors and others suggested that chronic activation of a protein called mTOR and the resulting impairment of autophagy may be a key driver of ME/CFS pathology, particularly post-exertional malaise (PEM). They hypothesized that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin could restore autophagy and therefore alleviate ME/CFS symptoms. This study aimed to test that hypothesis directly in patients for the first time.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a decentralized, uncontrolled, observational clinical study involving ME/CFS patients from six clinical centers in the United States. Of the 86 patients who started the therapy, 40 completed the full 90-day protocol. Participants self-administered low-dose rapamycin ($6\ \text{mg/week}$) and completed validated questionnaires (BAS, SSS, MFI, SF-36) at baseline and at 30, 60, and 90 days to assess changes in symptoms. Plasma samples were collected at the same time points to measure levels of two autophagy biomarkers, BECLIN-1 and phosphorylated ATG13 (pSer258-ATG13).
- **What has been found?**
Low-dose rapamycin ðŸ’Š was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. The study found statistically significant improvements in key ME/CFS symptoms, including fatigue, PEM, disturbed sleep, and orthostatic intolerance, in the cohort that completed the trial. These clinical improvements correlated with molecular evidence of restored autophagy: plasma levels of the inhibitory marker pSer258-ATG13 decreased significantly, while levels of the pro-autophagy marker BECLIN-1 increased. The therapeutic response was notably stronger in patients who had a post-infectious (viral) onset of their ME/CFS.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations, most significantly the absence of a placebo control group, which makes it impossible to definitively attribute the observed improvements to the drug alone. The study also relied on self-reported questionnaires rather than objective performance measures, had a high dropout rate (primarily due to the cost of the drug and lab tests not being covered), and did not control for variability between different generic formulations of rapamycin. However, the study's strengths include its biomarker-driven hypothesis and a within-subject design where each patient served as their own control.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that low-dose rapamycin can effectively and safely reduce fatigue, PEM, and other core symptoms in a subset of ME/CFS patients. The results provide the first clinical evidence supporting the theory that mTOR activation and impaired autophagy play a role in the disease's pathophysiology. The authors strongly recommend future research in the form of a larger, fully funded, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to validate these preliminary findings and suggest developing biomarker tests to identify patients most likely to respond to this therapy.
- **Summary:**
This study provides preliminary but promising evidence for a new ME/CFS treatment target. It suggests that in some patients, an overactive cellular pathway (mTOR) blocks a critical "clean-up" process called autophagy, contributing to symptoms. The use of low-dose rapamycin appeared to correct this issue, leading to significant reductions in fatigue and PEM, especially in patients whose illness began after an infection. The observed changes in blood biomarkers of autophagy support this mechanism. While this was a small, uncontrolled study requiring confirmation in a larger, placebo-controlled trial, it represents a significant step forward by testing a mechanistically-targeted therapy and identifying potential biomarkers to personalize treatment for ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a drug called rapamycin and found it helped reduce fatigue and PEM for many ME/CFS patients in this small, early-stage study. The drug appears to work by fixing a cellular cleaning process that may be broken, particularly in patients who became ill after an infection. Although more research is needed, this provides a hopeful new direction for a targeted treatment.

    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2025.2492774)
- **What was researched?**
This editorial reviews the current evidence for therapies that target autoantibodies (AAbs) as a potential treatment strategy for Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It summarizes the results of clinical trials for various immunomodulatory drugs and procedures.
- **Why was it researched?**
There is mounting evidence suggesting that autoimmunity, specifically the presence of harmful autoantibodies, plays a role in a subset of patients with PCS and ME/CFS. As there are no approved causal therapies for these conditions, exploring treatments that can remove or neutralize these autoantibodies is considered one of the most promising avenues for developing effective interventions.
- **How was it researched?**
This article is an expert opinion and literature review. The authors analyzed and summarized the findings from various clinical trials and observational studies investigating AAb-targeting therapies. The treatments reviewed include B-cell depleting agents like rituximab ðŸ’Š, immunoadsorption ðŸ’Š, intravenous immunoglobulins ðŸ’Š (IVIG), and newer drugs such as daratumumab ðŸ’Š, efgartigimod, and rovunaptabin (BC007).
- **What has been found?**
The review found mixed results across different AAb-targeting therapies. While early-phase trials of rituximab and observational studies of immunoadsorption and IVIG showed promising results in some ME/CFS and PCS patients, subsequent larger or controlled trials have often been disappointing. For instance, a phase III trial of rituximab failed to show significant benefits, and recent phase II trials of efgartigimod and rovunaptabin in PCS also failed to meet their primary endpoints. Preliminary results for daratumumab are encouraging but very early.
- **Discussion:**
The authors argue that a major reason for the inconsistent and often negative trial results is the failure to account for the heterogeneity of these illnesses. Most studies did not select patients based on evidence of autoimmunity, such as the presence of specific AAbs. This lack of patient stratification likely led to the inclusion of patients whose disease is not driven by autoantibodies, thereby diluting any potential treatment effect and contributing to trial failures.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that AAb-targeting therapy remains a promising strategy for a specific subgroup of PCS and ME/CFS patients. To move forward, future clinical trials must be designed with better patient selection criteria. They suggest using biomarkers, such as specific autoantibodies or a positive response to a preliminary treatment like immunoadsorption, to identify patients with a high likelihood of an AAb-mediated disease before enrolling them in trials for B-cell depleting therapies.
- **Summary:**
This review consolidates the idea that for a subset of ME/CFS and Post-COVID patients, the illness may be driven by an autoimmune process involving harmful antibodies. It explains that clinical trials for treatments targeting these antibodies have produced mixed results, likely because they were tested on broad patient groups rather than just those with clear signs of autoimmunity. The key message is that future research must focus on using biomarkers to identify the right patients for these specific therapies, a strategy that could finally lead to effective, personalized treatments for this subgroup of patients.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists reviewed different treatments that target the immune system for people with ME/CFS and Post-COVID Syndrome. The results have been mixed, suggesting these therapies may only help patients whose illness is caused by an autoimmune problem. Future studies need to use tests to find these specific patients before starting treatment, which could make the treatments much more successful.

- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the underlying physical causes of muscle fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) in ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. Researchers hypothesized that a "peripheral oxygenation deficit," caused by an inability to match oxygen delivery with the muscles' oxygen consumption, was a key factor. To test this, they examined the structure and function of the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) in the skeletal muscles of patients and healthy controls.
- **Why was it researched?**
Patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID suffer from debilitating muscle fatigue and PEM, but the biological reasons for these symptoms are not well understood. This research was prompted by the need to identify a concrete physiological mechanism that could explain why physical exertion leads to a severe worsening of symptoms. The study aimed to find physical evidence of microvascular defects that could impair oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle tissue.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a comparative laboratory study analyzing patient tissue and physiological responses to exercise. The researchers recruited three groups: ME/CFS patients, Long COVID patients, and healthy controls. They measured cardio-pulmonary function and muscle oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during and after an exercise test. Additionally, they took biopsies from the *vastus lateralis* (a large thigh muscle) to assess capillary density (capillarization), collagen IV deposits, and the ultrastructure of the capillaries using advanced microscopy.
- **What has been found?**
The study found significant structural abnormalities in the muscle capillaries of both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients compared to healthy controls. The capillary basement membrane, a layer surrounding the vessel, was significantly thicker, and there was increased deposition of collagen IV. This thickening resulted in a significantly smaller lumen radius, narrowing the channel through which blood flows. Furthermore, ME/CFS patients specifically showed significantly lower capillary density (fewer capillaries per muscle fiber). These structural issues correlated with reduced exercise capacity and were accompanied by signs of endothelial stress and damage to the cells lining the capillaries.
- **Discussion:**
The authors discuss how the observed abnormalitiesâ€”reduced lumen space, thickening of the basement membrane, and endothelial dysfunctionâ€”directly impair the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to muscle cells and hinder the removal of metabolic waste products. These microvascular defects create a physiological environment that predisposes patients to premature fatigue. The findings suggest that the problem is not just about blood flow volume but also about the diffusion capacity, which is compromised by the thickened vessel walls.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The study concludes that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit significant and pathological structural changes in their muscle microvasculature. These abnormalities provide a direct physical explanation for the impaired oxygen supply and exercise intolerance characteristic of these illnesses. Future work will likely focus on validating these findings in larger patient cohorts and investigating the upstream mechanisms causing this capillary damage, which could lead to new diagnostic tools and targeted treatments.
- **Summary:**
This research provides powerful visual evidence for a biological cause of muscle-related symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID. The discovery of thickened and narrowed capillaries, along with fewer capillaries in ME/CFS, helps explain why patients experience severe fatigue and post-exertional malaise. These physical blockages at a microscopic level can restrict blood flow, limit oxygen and nutrient delivery, and prevent waste clearance in the muscles. This moves the understanding of the illness away from subjective symptoms towards a defined, structural pathology and opens up new avenues for developing diagnostics and treatments aimed at repairing or improving microvascular function.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists discovered that the tiniest blood vessels in the muscles of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients are physically damaged, thicker, and narrower than in healthy people. This damage makes it harder for oxygen to reach the muscles and for waste to be removed, which helps explain the severe fatigue. These findings provide a concrete, physical reason for the illness and give researchers new targets for future treatments.

### 2025-02-21 Off-Label Drug List for ME/CFS and Post-Acute Infection Syndromes

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Reference Center for Post-Viral Syndromes
    - **Institutes:** Medical University of Vienna
    - **Publisher:** Medical University of Vienna
    - **Link:** [For doctors, healthcare professionals & stakeholders](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/referenzzentrum-postvirale-syndrome/fuer-aerztinnen-gesundheitsberufe/)
- **What was researched?**
The subject is not a research study, but rather the official announcement that in Austria, the costs for a list of specific off-label drugs for the treatment of ME/CFS and post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), such as Post-COVID Syndrome, will be covered by the statutory health insurance funds (Ã–GK, BVAEB, SVS).
- **Why was it researched?**
The aim of this initiative was to provide patients with access to potentially effective drug treatments that were not previously approved for these conditions. Since there are no approved therapies for ME/CFS and PAIS, this regulation is intended to close a gap in symptomatic care and alleviate the burden on those affected.
- **How was it researched?**
This is a health policy measure based on a collaboration between the Reference Center for Post-Viral Syndromes at the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian social insurance providers. The list was created and approved based on current scientific literature and clinical experience with the successful application of these drugs for symptom improvement.
- **What has been found?**
An agreement was reached that allows doctors to prescribe a range of off-label medications for the indication of ME/CFS and PAIS, with the costs covered by the insurance funds. The list includes medications for treating sleep-wake cycle disorders (e.g., Melatonin), mast cell activation syndromes (e.g., H1/H2 blockers like Desloratadine ðŸ’Š, Ketotifen ðŸ’Š), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (e.g., beta-blockers ðŸ’Š, Ivabradine ðŸ’Š, Mestinon ðŸ’Š), as well as endothelial dysfunction and microthrombi (e.g., statins ðŸ’Š, Sulodexide ðŸ’Š).
- **Discussion:**
The authors of the announcement emphasize that the use of these medications is still considered an "individual treatment attempt." This requires comprehensive patient education and consent. They urge caution regarding drug interactions and contraindications and strongly recommend the "start low, go slow" practice (starting with a very low dose and increasing slowly), which is well-established for ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The introduction of this medication list represents significant progress in the care of ME/CFS and PAIS patients in Austria. It creates an official framework for symptomatic treatment and improves access to therapies. Future work will include the systematic observation of treatment outcomes to further optimize care and create a basis for future clinical trials.
- **Summary:**
This new regulation in Austria provides patients with ME/CFS and PAIS, for the first time, with access to a range of health insurance-funded off-label medications. This allows for the targeted treatment of various symptoms such as sleep disorders, mast cell issues, POTS, or circulatory problems. While this is not a cure, it is a crucial step toward improving symptom management and quality of life, and it acknowledges the serious physical nature of these diseases, which requires a cautious and individualized treatment approach.
- **Simple Summary:**
Austrian health insurance funds will now pay for several medications to treat symptoms of ME/CFS and similar post-viral illnesses. This makes it easier for patients to get treatment for problems like sleep disorders, circulatory dysregulation, or mast cell activation. Doctors must work carefully with patients to find the right therapy and adjust the dosage slowly.

    - **Publisher:** Clinical Cardiology
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.70110)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the potential therapeutic benefits of a non-invasive nerve stimulation technique, called low-level tragus stimulation (LL-TS), for patients experiencing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) following a COVID-19 infection. Researchers examined the effect of this treatment on heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and levels of plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY).
- **Why was it researched?**
POTS, a form of dysautonomia characterized by an excessive heart rate increase upon standing, is frequently reported in Long COVID. Current treatments for POTS have limited effectiveness and can have significant side effects. The researchers hypothesized that LL-TS, which stimulates the vagus nerve, could help rebalance the autonomic nervous system by increasing parasympathetic ("rest-and-digest") activity and reducing sympathetic ("fight-or-flight") over-activity, thereby improving POTS.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trial involving 57 participants with confirmed post-COVID POTS. Patients were divided into two groups: 31 received genuine LL-TS via an ear clip device, and 26 received a sham (fake) stimulation. The treatment was administered for one hour twice daily for a month. Key measurements, including heart rate changes upon standing, HRV, and plasma NPY levels, were taken at the start of the study, after one month of treatment, and at a one-year follow-up.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that one month of LL-TS ðŸ’Š significantly reduced the excessive heart rate increase that patients experienced upon standing. This improvement was sustained at the one-year follow-up. The treatment also rebalanced the autonomic nervous system, as shown by improved HRV metrics (increased high-frequency power and decreased low-frequency power) during a standing test. Furthermore, LL-TS significantly lowered plasma levels of NPY, a neuropeptide associated with sympathetic nerve activity.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledged several limitations of the study. The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the results. The study focused on physiological measurements like heart rate and did not directly assess the broader range of clinical POTS symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment, headache). Additionally, the absence of a control group of healthy individuals or Long COVID patients without POTS makes it difficult to ascertain if the observed effects are specific to the POTS condition.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that LL-TS is a promising, non-invasive therapeutic approach for improving autonomic imbalance in individuals with POTS after a COVID-19 infection. They recommend that future research should involve larger, more diverse patient populations to confirm these findings. Subsequent studies should also directly assess the impact on clinical symptoms to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment's potential.
- **Summary:**
This research provides evidence for a non-drug, non-invasive treatment for POTS, a form of dysautonomia common in post-viral illnesses like Long COVID and sometimes seen in ME/CFS. The study suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve with a simple ear clip device can rebalance the autonomic nervous system, leading to a significant and lasting reduction in the excessive heart rate upon standing that defines POTS. By demonstrating improvements in objective markers like heart rate variability and neuropeptide Y, this study points towards a safe potential therapy that directly targets the underlying autonomic dysfunction.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists tested a small device that clips to the ear to treat the racing heart rate condition called POTS that can occur after COVID. The device helped calm the nervous system, significantly reducing patients' heart rate when they stood up, and the benefits lasted for a year. This research shows a promising new way to manage POTS symptoms without medication.

- **What was researched?**
This case report details the clinical journey of a 35-year-old woman with a long history of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The study investigated a potential genetic cause for her condition by performing a comprehensive exon analysis and documented her response to a treatment aimed at supporting mitochondrial function.
- **Why was it researched?**
The underlying cause of CFS is unknown, but emerging evidence points towards mitochondrial dysfunction as a key factor. Researchers are looking for specific biological markers and targeted treatments. This case presented an opportunity to explore a potential genetic link to mitochondrial problems in CFS and to assess the effectiveness of therapies designed to improve cellular energy production.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a single-patient case study. The patient, a 35-year-old Japanese woman with CFS since age 11, had previously failed to respond to conventional treatments. Her symptoms and quality of life were monitored over several years, including tracking her Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scores, while she was treated with supplements intended to enhance mitochondrial function. To investigate a genetic cause, comprehensive exon analysis was performed on the patient and two family members, followed by cDNA sequencing to confirm the functional impact of the identified mutation.
- **What has been found?**
Genetic analysis identified a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in the ADCK1 gene, which is known to be important for mitochondrial function. The patient experienced significant, dose-dependent improvements in fatigue and daily activities after treatment with oral 5-aminolevulinic acid with sodium ferrous citrate (5-ALA/SFC) ðŸ’Š and ubiquinone ðŸ’Š (also known as coenzyme Q10). While previous treatment with levocarnitine ðŸ’Š had provided some benefit, the combination of 5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone led to a much more substantial and sustained improvement in her condition.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that the patient's dramatic clinical improvement with mitochondrial-supportive supplements strongly suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction was a key driver of her illness. A limitation of the study is that the father's DNA was unavailable, which prevented the researchers from confirming if the ADCK1 mutation was inherited or occurred spontaneously (*de novo*). It also remains to be conclusively proven that this specific heterozygous mutation is sufficient to cause CFS, though the evidence is highly suggestive.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that this case highlights the importance of considering mitochondrial dysfunction in CFS and supports the potential of combining 5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone as a therapeutic strategy. The identification of the ADCK1 mutation suggests a genetic predisposition to mitochondrial issues in some CFS cases. The authors recommend further functional studies and family-based investigations to confirm the role of this ADCK1 mutation in CFS.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong evidence linking a specific genetic defect (a mutation in the ADCK1 gene) to mitochondrial dysfunction and severe symptoms in a patient with ME/CFS. The remarkable, life-changing improvement the patient experienced on a combination of supplements that support cellular energy production (5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone) suggests that her illness was directly tied to this biological issue. While this is a single case, it reinforces the mitochondrial dysfunction theory in ME/CFS and opens a potential path toward personalized medicine, where genetic testing could identify patients who may benefit from therapies that target cellular energy metabolism.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers found a new genetic mutation linked to problems with cell energy in a woman who has had ME/CFS for many years. She was given two supplements to help her cells produce energy, which led to a significant and lasting improvement in her fatigue. This case suggests that, for some patients, ME/CFS may be caused by a genetic issue, and that treatments supporting cell energy could be very helpful.

- **What was researched?**
This review article collects and synthesizes recent scientific evidence to explain the central role of skeletal muscle abnormalities in both Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It proposes a specific biological mechanism to explain how an initial infection can lead to the chronic symptoms of ME/CFS, particularly post-exertional malaise (PEM).
- **Why was it researched?**
The authors previously hypothesized in 2021 that impaired blood flow (hypoperfusion) to muscles in ME/CFS patients could cause an overload of sodium and calcium within muscle cells, leading to mitochondrial damage. Since then, new experimental studies have provided strong evidence supporting this concept, necessitating an updated review to consolidate these findings and build a more complete picture of the disease's pathophysiology.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that synthesizes findings from recent experimental research. The authors analyzed data from multiple types of studies, including muscle biopsies before and after exercise, electron microscopy to visualize cellular structures, 23-Na-MRI to measure sodium levels in muscle, and exercise tests that assess metabolic function in patients with PCS and ME/CFS.
- **What has been found?**
Recent studies provide direct evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and physical damage in the skeletal muscle of ME/CFS patients, particularly in the area just under the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal). This damage, which includes tissue necrosis after exercise, was not observed in non-ME/CFS Post-COVID patients. Furthermore, MRI studies have confirmed elevated sodium levels within the muscle cells of ME/CFS patients, supporting the theory that an exercise-induced ion imbalance (sodium and calcium overload) is the primary cause of the mitochondrial and muscle damage, as other potential causes like viral presence or myositis have been ruled out.
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose that ME/CFS can be understood as an "acquired ischemic mitochondrial myopathy," a muscle disease caused by poor blood flow and mitochondrial damage. They describe a vicious cycle where an initial vascular problem (common in acute COVID-19) triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further impair blood flow, making the condition chronic and self-sustaining. Risk factors like autoantibodies and certain genetic predispositions may explain why only a subset of Post-COVID patients transition to ME/CFS.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that a self-reproducing cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle is the central mechanism driving ME/CFS and its hallmark symptoms of exertional intolerance and PEM. They suggest that future treatments should focus on breaking this cycle by improving vascular perfusion and normalizing the ionic imbalance in muscles, rather than targeting the original infection. Promising therapeutic strategies under investigation include drugs that improve blood flow, like Mestinon ðŸ’Š and vericiguat ðŸ’Š, and treatments that neutralize harmful autoantibodies.
- **Summary:**
This review presents a compelling model that places skeletal muscle at the heart of ME/CFS pathophysiology. It argues that during exertion, insufficient blood flow causes a toxic buildup of calcium inside muscle cells, which damages their energy-producing mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage creates the profound energy deficit that defines post-exertional malaise. The process becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, explaining the chronic nature of the illness. This framework provides a concrete biological explanation for the disease's core symptoms and identifies clear, promising targets for future drug development aimed at improving muscle blood flow and protecting mitochondria.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists have gathered strong evidence that in ME/CFS, muscles are damaged during physical activity due to poor blood flow. This harms the cells' tiny powerhouses, called mitochondria, leading to a severe energy crisis that explains post-exertional malaise. This process can become a vicious cycle, which is why the illness is chronic and points toward future treatments to improve muscle blood flow.

- **What was researched?**
This review article synthesizes current scientific evidence to explain the underlying mechanisms of physical activity-induced post-exertional malaise (PEM). The authors aimed to build a comprehensive model of the pathophysiology by examining microvascular alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immunometabolic interactions in both Post-COVID Condition (PCC) and ME/CFS.
- **Why was it researched?**
PEM is a core diagnostic criterion for ME/CFS and a frequent, debilitating symptom in PCC, yet its biological causes remain poorly understood. Given the significant clinical overlap between PCC and ME/CFS, researchers hypothesize a common etiology might explain PEM in both conditions. This review sought to conceptualize the available evidence to improve the understanding of what triggers PEM episodes.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a narrative literature review. The authors analyzed and synthesized findings from multiple separate studies focusing on the pathophysiology of PCC and ME/CFS. No new experimental data was generated for this paper.
- **What has been found?**
The review concludes that patients with PEM exhibit reduced systemic oxygen extraction and impaired mitochondrial function upon physical activity. This is driven by several interconnected issues: microvascular dysfunction (including endothelial damage and the formation of fibrinolysis-resistant microclots), mitochondrial damage in muscle cells, and persistent immune activation, possibly due to viral antigen persistence. These problems force a premature switch to anaerobic metabolism, leading to the buildup of substances like lactate and reactive oxygen species, which in turn triggers further immune activation and exacerbates the underlying pathologies in a vicious cycle.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge a primary limitation is that the paper narratively synthesizes findings from many separate studies with different research focuses. They note that no single study has provided conclusive evidence for one overarching disease etiology, meaning the various pathophysiological observations described (e.g., microclots, mitochondrial dysfunction, immune activation) do not necessarily coexist in every patient.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that PEM results from dysfunctional physiological adaptation to exercise, creating a self-propagating loop where exertion leads to metabolic and ionic disturbances, secondary muscle and mitochondrial damage, and further immune activation. They recommend that future studies should investigate the connections between the immune system, metabolism, and microcirculation to better understand PEM. They also suggest that activity prescriptions for patients must account for these underlying mechanisms to avoid provoking PEM.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive review connects numerous strands of research to build a coherent biological model for post-exertional malaise (PEM). It posits that a combination of impaired microcirculation (poor blood flow in small vessels), damaged mitochondria (cellular energy factories), and a persistently activated immune system creates a vicious cycle where even minimal exertion can lead to a severe crash. This model helps explain the systemic nature of symptoms and why recovery is so prolonged. For patients, this work validates their experience by providing a multi-systemic, biological explanation and points towards specific future therapeutic targets, such as improving endothelial function with supplements like L-arginine ðŸ’Š, clearing viral reservoirs, or using immunomodulatory drugs, although these remain investigational.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists reviewed existing research to explain why activity causes crashes in people with ME/CFS and Long COVID. They believe that problems with tiny blood vessels, the body's energy production, and the immune system create a vicious cycle after exertion. Understanding this cycle helps explain the illness and gives researchers new ideas for future treatments.

    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369295)
- **What was researched?**
This study conducted an in-depth, four-year longitudinal investigation of a single, extremely severe ME/CFS patient with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD).  Researchers integrated longitudinal cytokine profiling with extensive health, clinical, pharmaceutical, and textual data to identify biological changes associated with a period of marginal symptom improvement. 
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS research is complicated by patient heterogeneity and a lack of approved diagnostics, and the most severely ill patients are often excluded from studies.  This research was motivated by the need to understand the immunopathology of severe ME/CFS by focusing on a single patient during a phase of slight improvement, aiming to uncover insights into disease mechanisms, severity, and potential therapeutic strategies. 
- **How was it researched?**
This was an N-of-1 longitudinal case study conducted over four years on an extremely severe, bedridden male ME/CFS patient with HSD.  Researchers collected nine blood samples during a period of marginal health improvement and performed multiplex cytokine profiling.  This biological data was integrated with comprehensive clinical records, medication logs, and textual analysis of the patient's blog posts using natural language processing to identify correlations between molecular changes and symptom severity. 
- **What has been found?**
The study found that the patient's marginal health improvement, particularly in cognitive function and sensory intolerance, correlated with a reduction in Th2-type cytokines and decreased activity of mast cells and eosinophils.  This suggests a Th2-dominant immune profile is associated with greater disease severity in this case.  The analysis also implicated the BCL6 and TP53 pathways in ME/CFS pathology.  The patient's improvement was observed after he began taking low-dose Abilify (aripiprazole) ðŸ’Š and increased his dose of Cortef (hydrocortisone) ðŸ’Š, while the dosage of other medications was reduced. 
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation is this being a single-patient study (N-of-1), which means the findings may not be generalizable to the broader ME/CFS population.  However, they argue that this deep, longitudinal approach on an extremely severe individual provides invaluable, high-resolution insights often missed in larger cross-sectional studies and highlights the importance of including this cohort in research. 
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that integrating longitudinal multi-modal data is a valuable approach for understanding ME/CFS.  They suggest that aberrant Th2-type cytokines and synergistic activities between mast cells and eosinophils are significant in ME/CFS pathogenesis, especially in severe cases, and may represent a shared mechanism with comorbidities like HSD and MCAS.  Future research should further explore these immune pathways, the roles of regulators like BCL6 and TP53, and the potential of low-dose drugs with partial agonist activity as treatments. 
- **Summary:**
This in-depth study of one extremely severe patient suggests that a specific type of immune imbalance, a Th2-dominant response involving mast cells and eosinophils, may drive severe symptoms like cognitive impairment and sensory overload. As the patient's health slightly improved, his immune markers shifted away from this Th2 profile, providing a potential biological explanation for changes in his condition. This finding strengthens the link between ME/CFS and related disorders like Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD). The patient's improvement while taking low-dose Abilify (aripiprazole) ðŸ’Š and Cortef (hydrocortisone) ðŸ’Š, while not proof of efficacy, points toward potential therapeutic avenues targeting neuro-immune pathways that warrant further investigation.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists closely studied one very severely ill patient for four years and found his symptoms improved slightly when a specific part of his immune system, often linked to allergies, calmed down. The patient's improvement was also associated with taking a low dose of the medication Abilify. These findings help explain the biology of the most severe cases and give researchers new ideas for future treatments.

### 2024-01-06 Advancing Research and Treatment: An Overview of Clinical Trials in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Future Perspectives

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Katharine A. Seton, JosÃ© A. Espejo-Oltra, Karen GimÃ©nez-Orenga, Rik Haagmans, Donia J. Ramadan, Jesper Mehlsen
    - **Institutes:** Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park; Max DelbrÃ¼ck Center for Molecular Medicine; Department of Pathology, School of Health Sciences, Universidad CatÃ³lica de Valencia.
    - **Publisher:** Journal of Clinical Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13020325)
- **What was researched?**
This paper provides a comprehensive review of clinical trials conducted over the last 33 years for ME/CFS. It synthesizes findings from studies on pharmacological drugs and dietary supplements that target dysfunctions in the immunological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. The review also offers recommendations for designing more effective future clinical trials.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a chronic, debilitating illness with no cure or FDA-approved treatment, and fewer than 5% of patients recover to their pre-illness activity levels. Past recommended treatments like Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) have been removed from guidelines due to evidence refuting their safety and efficacy. This creates an urgent need to evaluate the existing body of clinical trial evidence to identify promising research directions and improve the quality of future studies.
- **How was it researched?**
This study is a literature review that evaluates and summarizes past clinical trials in ME/CFS. The authors systematically analyzed studies investigating various interventions, grouping them based on the biological system they aimed to treat (e.g., antivirals for infection, immunosuppressants for autoimmunity). The paper also critically assesses the types of outcome measures used in ME/CFS research, comparing subjective patient-reported questionnaires to objective measurements.
- **What has been found?**
The review identified several interventions with promising but not yet definitive results that require larger trials. Antivirals like valacyclovir (VACV) ðŸ’Š, valganciclovir (VGCV) ðŸ’Š, and artesunate ðŸ’Š showed some efficacy in patients with evidence of herpesvirus reactivation. Metabolic supplements such as L-carnitine ðŸ’Š, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) ðŸ’Š, NADH ðŸ’Š, and D-ribose ðŸ’Š improved symptoms like fatigue and pain in some studies. Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) ðŸ’Š showed promise for improving energy, sleep, and pain in retrospective reports. The immunomodulator rintatolimod ðŸ’Š is the only drug to have successfully completed a Phase III trial, showing improved exercise tolerance, but it remains an experimental drug in most countries. Many other interventions, including rituximab and various probiotics, yielded mixed or negative results in larger trials.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight significant limitations in past ME/CFS research, particularly the overwhelming reliance on subjective Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). They argue that these questionnaires are prone to bias and may not be reliable or valid in the ME/CFS population, as demonstrated by studies where open-label trials showed positive results that were not replicated in subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The review also notes that many promising findings come from small or open-label studies, emphasizing the need for larger, more rigorous validation.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that rintatolimod is the most successful treatment investigated to date, though it is not widely available. They strongly recommend that future clinical trials be more robustly designed, utilizing stringent case definitions that include post-exertional malaise (PEM) as a core symptom. The paper calls for a shift away from subjective questionnaires toward objective outcome measures, such as accelerometers to monitor physical activity, and suggests that trials should focus on specific, evidence-based patient subgroups to improve the chances of success.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive review of over three decades of ME/CFS clinical trials provides a critical overview of what has been tested and where research should go next. While no single cure has been found, the paper identifies several promising avenues, including treatments targeting viral infections, immune dysfunction, and cellular energy metabolism, that have shown benefits for at least some patients. The most important contribution of this work is its clear roadmap for improving future research: scientists must conduct larger, better-designed trials on well-defined patient groups and use objective data, like from activity trackers, to prove a treatment works. This approach is essential for moving past the inconsistent results of the past and developing the first evidence-based, approved treatments for ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed over 30 years of studies to identify treatments that have helped people with ME/CFS. They found that some drugs targeting viruses, the immune system, and energy production have shown promise, but require more investigation. The paper concludes that future research must be better designed, using objective tools like activity trackers, to find effective treatments.

### 2023-12-27 Identification of CD8 T-cell dysfunction associated with symptoms in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID and treatment with a nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen agent in a retrospective case series

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Gil, Anna; Hoag, George E.; Salerno, John P.
    - **Institutes:** University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Department of Pathology; Inspiritol, Inc.; The Salerno Center for Complementary Medicine.
    - **Publisher:** Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2023.100720)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the function of a specific type of immune cell, the CD8 T-cell, in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID compared to healthy individuals. It also retrospectively analyzed whether a nebulized treatment with antioxidant and anti-pathogen properties could improve both this immune cell dysfunction and patient-reported symptoms.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS and Long COVID share many symptoms and are often triggered by infections, suggesting they may have a common underlying pathology involving a dysregulated immune system. Researchers hypothesized that an aberrant immune response leads to CD8 T-cell dysfunction, similar to the "T-cell exhaustion" seen in chronic viral infections. This study aimed to identify a specific biomarker for these conditions and explore a potential multi-mechanism treatment targeting oxidative stress and immune dysregulation.
- **How was it researched?**
The study involved two parts. First, a laboratory analysis was conducted on fresh blood samples from 12 ME/CFS patients, 8 Long COVID patients, and 10 healthy controls to measure CD8 T-cell function via intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Second, it presented a retrospective case series of 8 of these patients (4 ME/CFS, 4 Long COVID) who independently chose to use a nebulized treatment, Inspiritol, for a period of 3-15 months. Researchers reviewed changes in their T-cell function and symptom severity scores over the course of the treatment.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that CD8 T-cells from both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients had a significantly diminished capacity to produce the cytokines IFNy and TNFa after stimulation compared to healthy controls, confirming a state of immune dysfunction. In the retrospective case series of 8 patients treated with a nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen agent (Inspiritol) ðŸ’Š, there was an observed improvement in this CD8 T-cell function that occurred in parallel with symptom improvement. On average, these patients reported a 54% decrease in overall symptom severity, and no serious treatment-associated side effects were noted.
- **Discussion:**
The authors suggest that the observed CD8 T-cell dysfunction is a fundamental aspect of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, potentially explaining the body's inability to control latent pathogens. They note that the multi-component nature of the nebulized agent, which has antioxidant, anti-pathogen, and immunomodulatory properties, may address several underlying mechanisms of the diseases simultaneously. The primary limitation is the small number of patients in the retrospective, uncontrolled case series, which means the results are preliminary.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that CD8 T-cell dysfunction appears to be a key feature of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, and that this measurement has potential as a diagnostic and treatment-tracking biomarker. The positive results from the retrospective case series, although preliminary, support advancing the nebulized agent into larger, controlled clinical trials to formally evaluate its safety and efficacy for both conditions.
- **Summary:**
This study provides evidence for a specific, measurable dysfunction in the immune systems of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, where key "killer" T-cells (CD8 T-cells) appear exhausted and are unable to function properly. This finding could lead to the development of a standardized, objective blood test to aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, the paper presents preliminary but encouraging results from a small group of patients who used a novel nebulized treatment and experienced significant symptom reduction alongside a partial reversal of this immune dysfunction. While not a cure, this research opens a new avenue for therapies that target immune modulation and oxidative stress, though these findings must be validated in larger clinical trials.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists have identified a specific defect in the immune cells of people with ME/CFS and Long COVID, which may help explain the illness. This discovery could be used to create a new blood test to help with diagnosis. In a small, preliminary study, a nebulized antioxidant treatment appeared to improve both this immune defect and patient symptoms, opening a new path for future research.

- **What was researched?**
This study aimed to analyze and compare autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia) and small fiber neuropathy (SFN) in patients with post-COVID condition and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) against a group of healthy controls. The researchers also investigated how these conditions might relate to symptoms like cognitive impairment and fatigue.
- **Why was it researched?**
Post-COVID condition and ME/CFS share many symptoms, including fatigue, "brain fog," and autonomic issues. Previous research has described both dysautonomia and SFN in these patient groups, and it's hypothesized that these neurological problems could be an underlying cause of the debilitating fatigue. This study sought to systematically compare these factors across both illnesses to better understand their similarities and differences.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a comparative study involving 87 patients with post-COVID condition, 50 with ME/CFS, and 50 healthy controls. Autonomic function was assessed using hemodynamic tests like the Tilt Table Test, Valsalva maneuver, and deep breathing tests. The presence of SFN was evaluated using Sudoscan, which measures sweat gland function controlled by small nerves, and by testing the nerves' response to heat and cold stimuli (evoked potentials). All participants also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation.
- **What has been found?**
Both ME/CFS and post-COVID patients exhibited significantly higher heart rates at rest and during standing compared to healthy controls. A high percentage of patients met the criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): 31% of the ME/CFS group and 13.8% of the post-COVID group. Both patient groups showed significantly delayed nerve responses to heat stimuli, suggesting damage to small, unmyelinated C-type nerve fibers. Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients had abnormal Sudoscan results in their hands compared to their feet, indicating a "non-length-dependent" SFN, where the neuropathy is patchy rather than starting at the extremities.
- **Discussion:**
The authors noted several limitations, including unequal sample sizes for the patient groups and a different gender distribution across groups, which could introduce bias. They also pointed out that a surprisingly high number of healthy controls showed some pathological autonomic results, which might have masked some of the differences between the patient and control groups. Despite these limitations, the study is highlighted as the first to directly compare these specific autonomic and neuropathic characteristics across both ME/CFS and post-COVID patient cohorts.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors concluded that both ME/CFS and post-COVID condition are characterized by inappropriate tachycardia, a high prevalence of POTS, and evidence of sensory small fiber neuropathy. They recommend future studies with larger control groups to establish clear pathological thresholds for these tests. The researchers also suggest using additional techniques like corneal confocal microscopy to further assess SFN and analyzing for autoantibodies to explore a potential autoimmune cause for these conditions.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong, objective evidence supporting the biological basis of symptoms in both ME/CFS and post-COVID. It demonstrates that dysautonomia and small fiber neuropathy are significant, measurable features shared by both illnesses. The confirmation of a high prevalence of POTS, along with physical evidence of damage to small nerve fibers (from delayed heat response times), validates common patient complaints. The finding of a non-length-dependent SFN is a key detail that may help guide future diagnostic efforts and research into the mechanisms of nerve damage in these conditions.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers confirmed that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID often have problems with their autonomic nervous system, causing issues like a very fast heart rate when standing (POTS). The study also found physical evidence of damage to the tiny nerve fibers that sense temperature. These findings help prove that the symptoms are caused by real, biological problems and could lead to better diagnostic tests in the future.

### 2023-10-09 Observational Study of Repeat Immunoadsorption (RIA) in Post-COVID ME/CFS Patients with Elevated ÃŸ2-Adrenergic Receptor Autoantibodiesâ€”An Interim Report

    - **Publisher:** Journal of Clinical Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12196428)
- **What was researched?**
This observational study evaluated the efficacy of a treatment called Immunoadsorption (IA) for patients who developed ME/CFS after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary goal was to assess whether this treatment could improve the physical and functional ability of patients who had elevated levels of specific autoantibodies (ÃŸ2-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies). This paper presents the interim results from the first ten patients treated in the study.
- **Why was it researched?**
There is increasing evidence that ME/CFS, particularly after an infection, may have an autoimmune basis. Previous small studies suggested that IA, a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood, was effective in post-infectious ME/CFS. Since autoantibodies against ÃŸ2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2 AABs) have been linked to symptom severity in post-COVID ME/CFS, the researchers hypothesized that removing these autoantibodies with IA could be a promising therapeutic approach for this patient group.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a prospective observational study involving ten patients diagnosed with post-COVID ME/CFS who also had elevated ADRB2 autoantibodies. Each patient underwent five sessions of Immunoadsorption (IA) over a ten-day period, a procedure that filters immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the blood plasma. The main outcome was the change in physical function, measured using the SF-36 Physical Function (SF36-PF) questionnaire, assessed four weeks after the treatment. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, and cognitive issues, were also evaluated using standardized scales.
- **What has been found?**
Four weeks after treatment, seven of the ten patients showed a clinically significant improvement in physical function, with their SF36-PF scores increasing by 10 to 45 points. This improvement was accompanied by a significant reduction in muscle pain and immune-related symptoms in these "responders". Although IA successfully lowered the levels of the targeted autoantibodies in all patients, these levels began to rise again within four weeks. Interestingly, there was no significant change in fatigue scores, and the degree of clinical improvement did not correlate with the reduction in autoantibody levels.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight that the study's primary limitations are the small number of patients and the lack of a control group. They suggest that the observed benefits may not be solely due to the removal of autoantibodies, as there was no correlation between antibody levels and patient response; other mechanisms, such as effects on the B cells that produce antibodies, might be involved. The authors also note that fatigue often improves later in the recovery process, which might explain why physical function improved while fatigue scores did not.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that these preliminary results provide evidence that Immunoadsorption has efficacy in a subset of patients with post-COVID ME/CFS, supporting the theory that autoantibodies play a role in the disease mechanism. These findings justify moving forward with larger, more definitive studies, including a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sham (placebo) apheresis group and an RCT that combines IA with a B-cell depleting therapy. The study also plans to investigate if repeat IA treatments can lead to longer-lasting remission in patients who initially respond but later decline.
- **Summary:**
This study investigated a blood-filtering treatment called Immunoadsorption to remove potentially harmful autoantibodies in 10 patients with post-COVID ME/CFS. A promising 7 out of 10 patients experienced a significant improvement in their physical function four weeks after treatment, though their reported fatigue levels did not change. This finding supports the idea that the immune system, and specifically these autoantibodies, may contribute to the disease in some individuals. While these early results are encouraging, this was a small, uncontrolled study, and the treatment itself was physically demanding for patients. The study serves as a critical stepping stone, providing the necessary evidence to launch larger, placebo-controlled trials to confirm the treatment's effectiveness.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested a special blood filtering treatment, called Immunoadsorption, on a small group of 10 people with post-COVID ME/CFS. Seven of the ten patients showed a noticeable improvement in their physical abilities a month after the therapy. These encouraging early results will help guide bigger and more thorough studies in the future to see if this can be a helpful treatment.

### 2023-06-22 Study to Investigate Improvement in Physical Function in SF-36 With Vericiguat Compared With Placebo in Participants With Post-COVID-19 Syndrome

- **Overview:**
    - **Trial ID:** NCT05697640
    - **Link:** https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05697640
    - **Sponsor / Lead:** CharitÃ© University, Berlin, Germany
    - **Location(s):** Berlin, Germany
    - **Phase:** Phase 2
    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-06-22
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31
- **Purpose of the Trial:**
This trial aims to see if an approved drug called Vericiguat ðŸ’Š can relieve profound fatigue and other symptoms in people with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), including those who meet the criteria for ME/CFS. The study is based on the theory that impaired blood flow in small blood vessels contributes to PCS symptoms.

- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether early outpatient treatment for acute COVID-19 with one of three medicationsâ€”metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamineâ€”could reduce the incidence of a subsequent diagnosis of post-COVID-19 condition (Long COVID) over a 10-month follow-up period.
- **Why was it researched?**
Long COVID is a significant and emerging public health crisis, yet few randomized trials have assessed whether early treatments for the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can prevent its long-term consequences. This research was motivated by the urgent need to find a safe, affordable, and globally available intervention to reduce the risk of developing this chronic condition.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a large, remote (decentralised), randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted in the USA. The study included 1,126 adults aged 30-85 with overweight or obesity who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms for less than a week. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either metformin ðŸ’Š, ivermectin, fluvoxamine, or a matching placebo, and were followed for up to 300 days to see if they received a Long COVID diagnosis from a medical provider.
- **What has been found?**
Early outpatient treatment with metformin ðŸ’Š significantly reduced the incidence of Long COVID. The cumulative incidence of a Long COVID diagnosis by day 300 was 6.3% in the metformin group compared to 10.4% in the placebo group, representing a 41% reduction in risk. The beneficial effect was even stronger when metformin was started within three days of symptom onset. In contrast, neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed any effect on reducing the incidence of Long COVID compared to placebo.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that a major strength of the study is its randomized, quadruple-blind design, which limits potential bias. A limitation is the potential for selection bias, as trial participants may not represent the general population. The study also excluded adults with a normal BMI or those under 30, so it is unknown if the findings apply to these groups.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that early outpatient treatment with metformin during an acute COVID-19 infection effectively reduces the risk of developing Long COVID. Fluvoxamine and ivermectin were not effective for this purpose. The researchers suggest future trials are needed to assess therapeutics for Long COVID prevention in other populations, including those who are vaccinated or have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infections.
- **Summary:**
This is a landmark study as it is the first large-scale randomized trial to show that an existing, safe, and low-cost medication can prevent Long COVID. The findings suggest that taking metformin ðŸ’Š early during a COVID-19 infection could cut the risk of developing long-term symptoms by over 40%. This provides a potential and immediately actionable strategy to mitigate the long-term public health burden of COVID-19, though further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness across different populations, such as those who are vaccinated or not overweight.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested three different drugs to see if taking them during a COVID-19 infection could prevent Long COVID. They found that metformin, a safe and inexpensive drug normally used for diabetes, significantly reduced the chance of getting Long COVID. The other two drugs tested, ivermectin and fluvoxamine, did not show any benefit.

    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.29011/2577-1515.100216)
- **What was researched?**
This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a blood filtration procedure called Heparin-mediated Extracorporeal Low-density lipoprotein Precipitation (H.E.L.P.) apheresis as a potential treatment for patients with severe, persistent Long COVID symptoms. The research aimed to assess if repeated treatments could lead to clinical recovery and long-term functional improvement.
- **Why was it researched?**
Long COVID is a debilitating condition with no proven effective treatments, and there is growing evidence that it may be caused by persistent, fibrinolysis-resistant microclots and systemic inflammation that block capillaries and impair oxygen transport to tissues. H.E.L.P. apheresis is a procedure known to remove clotting factors like fibrinogen, inflammatory mediators, and other pathological substances from the blood, making it a plausible therapeutic candidate to address the hypothesized underlying cause of Long COVID symptoms.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a retrospective pilot study (case series) involving 17 patients (ages 23-63) with a formal diagnosis of Long COVID and severe symptoms lasting 2-12 months. Each participant received between 1 to 7 sessions of H.E.L.P. apheresis. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated using questionnaires to assess symptoms before and after the treatment course, along with a 6-10 month telephonic follow-up. Blood tests for inflammatory and coagulation markers like fibrinogen, D-Dimer, and CRP were also conducted before and after treatments to monitor physiological changes.
- **What has been found?**
The treatment showed significant positive effects. Of the 17 patients, 16 experienced immediate and substantial improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. After completing their treatment course, 12 patients reported complete or near-complete resolution of all symptoms, returning to their pre-infection baseline. A follow-up at 6-10 months found that these benefits were maintained or had continued to improve in 15 of the patients. Only one patient did not experience symptomatic relief, although their blood oxygen saturation did improve.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge that this was a small pilot study without a control group, which is a significant limitation. The lack of a control group was attributed to the high cost and limited availability of H.E.L.P. apheresis machines. They also noted that the optimal number of treatments required is still unknown and may depend on how long a patient has been ill. The authors hypothesize that the observed benefits are primarily due to the removal of circulating microclots and the restoration of normal clotting function and oxygen delivery.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that H.E.L.P. apheresis is a promising and safe treatment option that can significantly reduce clinical symptoms and improve long-term function in patients with Long COVID. They strongly emphasize the urgent need for larger, controlled studies to rigorously evaluate the procedure's efficacy and safety before it can be considered a standard treatment. Future research should also explore its potential use in acute severe COVID-19 and other post-viral illnesses with similar proposed mechanisms, such as ME/CFS.
- **Summary:**
This study provides preliminary but highly encouraging evidence for H.E.L.P. apheresis as a treatment for Long COVID. The research supports the theory that persistent microclots and inflammation play a key role in the illness by demonstrating that physically filtering these components from the blood can lead to dramatic and lasting clinical improvements. For patients, this suggests a potential, tangible treatment that addresses an underlying biological mechanism, though it is still experimental and not widely available. The overwhelmingly positive results in this small group strongly justify the larger, controlled clinical trials needed to confirm these findings and potentially establish this as a standard of care.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists tested a special blood filtering treatment on 17 patients with severe Long COVID to remove tiny clots and inflammation. Almost all patients in the study experienced major and long-lasting improvements in their symptoms. This early result is very promising, but much larger studies are now needed to confirm that it is a safe and effective treatment.s

    - **Publisher:** BMJ Open
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062322)
- **What was researched?**
This study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for treating the core symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), such as pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
- **Why was it researched?**
Fibromyalgia is an incurable chronic condition for which current treatments often provide only moderate or temporary relief and can cause significant side effects. Accumulating evidence suggests HBOT, a non-invasive therapy, may be an effective treatment, but previous reviews lacked sufficient evidence and a formal meta-analysis to confirm its benefits and safety for FM.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. Researchers searched multiple scientific databases for studies on HBOT for FM published up to October 2022. They identified and analyzed nine studies (three randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized controlled trials) involving a total of 288 patients. A meta-analysis was performed on the data for pain relief from the three randomized trials, while other outcomes were analyzed descriptively.
- **What has been found?**
The meta-analysis showed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) ðŸ’Š significantly relieved pain in FM patients compared to control interventions. Most of the included studies also reported that HBOT improved other core symptoms, including tender points, fatigue, multidimensional function, overall patient well-being, and sleep disturbance. Adverse events, most commonly mild and reversible barotrauma (ear pressure issues), occurred in 23.8% of patients receiving HBOT, with 6.5% withdrawing due to side effects; no serious adverse events were reported.
- **Discussion:**
The authors identify the primary limitation as the small number of randomized controlled trials included, which could lead to bias or insufficient evidence. They also note that the clinical heterogeneity in HBOT protocols (e.g., treatment duration and pressure levels) across the studies may have influenced the results. The authors speculate that FM patients may have a lower pain threshold and be more sensitive to discomfort, which could explain the higher rate of adverse events compared to rates reported in other diseases.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that HBOT may have a positive effect on improving pain and other core symptoms of FM, with reversible side effects. They suggest that using lower pressure (less than 2.0 atmospheric absolute) may be beneficial for reducing adverse events. The study calls for further high-quality, large-sample randomized controlled trials to better evaluate HBOT's efficacy, safety, and optimal treatment protocol for FM.
- **Summary:**
This comprehensive review suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a promising treatment for fibromyalgia, offering significant pain relief and improvements in fatigue, sleep, and overall function. The therapy appears to be generally safe, with the most common side effects being mild, reversible ear pressure issues that might be reduced by using lower-pressure protocols. While the evidence is encouraging, the authors highlight that it is based on a small number of studies. This research reinforces the potential of HBOT as a non-invasive option for FM, warranting larger, more rigorous clinical trials to confirm its benefits and establish standardized treatment guidelines.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers analyzed nine studies and found that high-pressure oxygen therapy can significantly reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia. The therapy also appeared to help with other symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep. While some patients experienced mild, temporary side effects like ear pressure, the treatment was considered safe overall.

    - **Publisher:** Journal of Translational Medicine
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-022-03616-z)
- **What was researched?**
This study aimed to assess and compare the sodium content in the lower leg muscles of patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls.  The researchers measured sodium levels both at rest (baseline) and over a 40-minute period following a brief, standardized leg exercise, and correlated these findings with handgrip strength. 
- **Why was it researched?**
Muscle fatigue and pain are core symptoms of ME/CFS.  Previous evidence points towards hypoperfusion (reduced blood flow) in ME/CFS, which is hypothesized to cause an electrolyte imbalance, specifically an overload of sodium in the muscles.  This study was designed to directly test this hypothesis by non-invasively measuring muscle sodium content. 
- **How was it researched?**
This was a small pilot study involving six female ME/CFS patients and six age, BMI, and sex-matched healthy controls.  The researchers used a specialized magnetic resonance imaging technique (${}^{23}Na$-MRI) on a clinical 3T scanner to quantify sodium content in five different muscle compartments of the left lower leg.  Measurements were taken before and repeatedly for 40 minutes after a 3-minute anaerobic plantar flexion exercise (heel raises), and handgrip strength was also assessed. 
- **What has been found?**
At baseline, ME/CFS patients had significantly higher tissue sodium content in all five lower leg muscle compartments compared to healthy controls.  Following exercise, sodium content increased in both groups, but the increase was more pronounced and the recovery was slower in the ME/CFS group.  Patients also exhibited reduced handgrip strength, and there was a significant inverse correlation: higher average muscle sodium content was associated with lower handgrip strength. 
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation of this research is its very small sample size, as it was a preliminary pilot study.  They also note that the results may have been influenced by the baseline immobility of the patients and potential variations in exercise intensity, which could be better controlled in future studies using an MRI-compatible exercise apparatus.  The specific MRI protocol used was better at measuring extracellular sodium, and the authors recommend different techniques for future studies to more accurately differentiate between intracellular and extracellular sodium. 
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The study concludes that ${}^{23}Na$-MRI confirms the hypothesis of increased sodium content in the muscles of ME/CFS patients, both at rest and after exercise.  These findings provide evidence that sodium overload may play a role in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS and could open up new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.  The authors state that these encouraging results warrant further research with larger patient populations and refined methodologies. 
- **Summary:**
This study provides the first direct, non-invasive evidence of a "sodium overload" in the muscles of ME/CFS patients. This finding supports the theory that impaired blood flow and cellular energy production lead to an inability of muscle cells to properly regulate electrolytes. This excess sodium, which worsens after even brief exertion, was directly linked to reduced muscle strength and offers a plausible biological explanation for key symptoms like muscle pain, weakness, and post-exertional malaise. Although this was a very small pilot study, it successfully demonstrates a new method for observing a key pathological process in ME/CFS and strengthens the case for targeting ion channel dysfunction in future treatment research.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists used a special MRI to discover that the muscles of ME/CFS patients contain too much sodium, even when resting. This sodium buildup gets worse after short exercise and is linked to weaker muscles, which may help explain fatigue and pain. This early research points to a physical problem with how muscles handle electrolytes and opens a new door for future studies.

    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2022.205.1_MeetingAbstracts.A2063)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether a single 60mg dose of pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, could acutely improve exercise tolerance in ME/CFS patients. Researchers measured changes in peak oxygen uptake ($VO_{2}$ max) and other cardiovascular functions during back-to-back invasive exercise tests.
- **Why was it researched?**
The study was motivated by the observation that about one-third of ME/CFS patients have small fiber neuropathy (SFN), which can cause neurovascular dysregulation. The researchers hypothesized that impaired blood vessel constriction during upright exercise reduces blood flow back to the heart and creates a mismatch between blood supply and muscle demand, and that pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š could correct this by improving vascular regulation.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 45 ME/CFS patients, of whom 39 (all women) were included in the final analysis. All participants first underwent an invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET) to confirm low filling pressures in the heart. Eligible subjects were then randomly and blindly given either 60mg of pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š or a placebo, followed by a second iCPET after a 50-minute rest period to assess the drug's effect.
- **What has been found?**
The group receiving pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š showed a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption ($VO_{2}$ max) during the second exercise test compared to the placebo group. In the treatment group, key measures of cardiovascular function like oxygen uptake ($VO_{2}$), cardiac output (Qt), and right atrial pressure (RAP) increased significantly from the first test to the second, whereas these measures tended to decrease in the placebo group, indicating a worsening of function after the first exertion.
- **Discussion:**
As an abstract, the paper does not contain a detailed discussion of limitations. However, it notes that while 38% of subjects had objective evidence of small fiber neuropathy (SFN), there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of SFN between the treatment and placebo groups, suggesting the drug's beneficial effects may not be exclusive to patients with confirmed SFN.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that these findings suggest neurovascular dysregulation is a fundamental cause of acute exercise intolerance in ME/CFS. The study also provides new evidence that prior exertion worsens this vascular dysregulation, offering a physiological insight into post-exertional malaise (PEM), a hallmark symptom of the disease.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong evidence for a specific physiological problem in ME/CFS known as "preload failure," where impaired blood vessel function reduces blood return to the heart during exercise. The drug pyridostigmine ðŸ’Š appears to temporarily correct this issue, leading to improved exercise capacity. Importantly, the worsening performance of the placebo group on the second test offers an objective measurement that mirrors the clinical phenomenon of post-exertional malaise. This research identifies a key mechanism of the disease and points to a class of existing drugs that could be further investigated as a potential treatment.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers found that a drug called pyridostigmine improved blood flow and the ability to exercise in a short-term test for people with ME/CFS. This suggests that problems with blood vessel control are a key part of the illness. The study provides a physical explanation for why exercise can make patients feel worse and points to a new direction for treatment research.

    - **Publisher:** Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.888232)
- **What was researched?**
This paper explores the hypothesis that a dysfunction of neurogliaâ€”the support and immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) such as astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytesâ€”could be the common underlying cause for the wide range of biological abnormalities observed in ME/CFS. The authors reviewed existing scientific literature to test whether this "neuroglial failure" model could explain the two most defining features of the illness: post-exertional malaise (PEM) and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF).
- **Why was it researched?**
While numerous potential disease mechanisms for ME/CFS have been identified, including immune, metabolic, and vascular problems, it remains unclear how these different pathways are connected. Glial cell dysfunction has been previously suggested as a key feature of ME/CFS, but a comprehensive review was lacking. This paper aimed to provide a unifying hypothesis that could connect these disparate findings into a single, cohesive pathobiological framework.
- **How was it researched?**
This study was a hypothesis and theory paper based on a non-systematic literature review. The authors analyzed and synthesized existing research on the clinical and pathobiological features of ME/CFS. They focused specifically on whether the core characteristics of PEM and abnormal CBF could be mechanistically explained by the known functions and dysfunctions of neuroglial cells.
- **What has been found?**
The review concludes that neuroglial dysfunction provides a plausible explanation for the core features of ME/CFS. The authors propose that in ME/CFS, neuroglial cells exist in a "primed" or hyper-reactive state, which would explain the delayed onset, prolonged duration, and multi-systemic nature of PEM as a response to various stressors. Furthermore, since glial cells are central to regulating blood flow in the brain through neurovascular coupling and the baroreflex, their dysfunction would directly account for the consistently observed deficits in cerebral blood flow.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations to their hypothesis that require further investigation. The presence of CNS inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in ME/CFS has not yet been definitively proven. Additionally, the specific roles and interactions of the different glial cell populations (microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) in the disease process remain to be defined.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that regulatory failure of the CNS due to dysfunctional neuroglia may be the central process that orchestrates the clinical presentation of ME/CFS. This model links peripheral issues like immune and endothelial dysfunction to a central mechanism. The authors propose a greater research focus on the role of neuroglia in ME/CFS and suggest re-examining existing therapies that may target these cells, such as minocycline ðŸ’Š, aripiprazole ðŸ’Š, and low dose naltrexone ðŸ’Š.
- **Summary:**
This paper offers a unifying theory that places malfunctioning brain immune cells, known as neuroglia, at the center of ME/CFS pathology. It suggests these cells are stuck in a hyper-reactive state, providing a potential biological reason for post-exertional malaise and the widespread problems with brain blood flow. This "neuroglial failure" hypothesis does not dismiss other findings like mitochondrial or vascular issues, but rather proposes a central mechanism in the brain that connects them. This provides a valuable framework that could help guide future research toward developing treatments that specifically target the neuro-immune interface of the central nervous system.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists propose a new theory that ME/CFS may be caused by malfunctioning support and immune cells in the brain. This malfunction could explain key symptoms like post-exertional malaise and reduced blood flow to the brain. This idea helps connect many different research findings and gives scientists a new target to study for future treatments.

    - **Publisher:** JCI Insight
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.157621)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the changes in 1,157 plasma metabolites in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls in response to an exercise challenge. The researchers monitored these changes before and after two maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by 24 hours, a protocol specifically designed to provoke post-exertional malaise (PEM) in patients.
- **Why was it researched?**
PEM is a hallmark symptom of ME/CFS, yet its underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. While previous studies have analyzed the metabolome of ME/CFS patients at rest, none had tracked the metabolic changes over time following a standardized exercise stressor intended to induce PEM. This research aimed to identify the specific metabolic disruptions that occur during the response to and recovery from exertion.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a longitudinal study analyzing blood samples from 60 ME/CFS patients and 45 healthy, sedentary controls. Participants performed two maximal-effort CPETs on a stationary bike, 24 hours apart. Plasma samples were collected at four key time points: before and after exercise on day 1, and before and after exercise on day 2. The relative levels of 1,157 metabolites were then measured and analyzed using advanced statistical and pathway analysis methods to compare the metabolic response and recovery patterns between the two groups.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that the metabolic differences between ME/CFS patients and controls became more pronounced after the exercise challenges. The 24-hour recovery period was particularly abnormal in the ME/CFS cohort, with over a quarter of the identified metabolic pathways being statistically different from controls. Many of these disrupted pathways, including those for lipids and energy, appeared to be connected through glutamate metabolism. The study also highlighted that a large percentage of the most significantly different metabolites between groups were of unknown chemical identity.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that their findings at baseline are consistent with previous ME/CFS metabolomics literature, which has pointed to dysregulation in amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism. The study's strength lies in its longitudinal design using an exercise stressor, which revealed accumulating metabolic disturbances not apparent in a resting state. A noted limitation was the small size of the male cohort, which hindered the statistical power to draw firm conclusions about sex-specific differences, although trends were observed.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that ME/CFS patients exhibit a profoundly disrupted metabolic response and recovery following exertion, providing insight into the molecular changes that likely contribute to PEM. Future work requires large-scale studies to confirm these findings and to identify the unknown metabolites that were significantly altered, which may play a critical role in the disease's mechanisms.
- **Summary:**
This study provides strong, objective evidence for the biological reality of post-exertional malaise. It shows that the bodies of people with ME/CFS do not just respond differently to exercise but, more importantly, fail to recover properly on a metabolic level, with abnormalities worsening 24 hours later. The research points to a central disruption in how the body manages energy and building blocks, with glutamate-related pathways emerging as a key area of dysfunction. While not identifying a simple diagnostic test, this work demonstrates that a dynamic stress test is far more revealing than a static one and opens new avenues for understanding and potentially treating the metabolic chaos that follows exertion in ME/CFS.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists measured over a thousand substances in the blood of patients before and after two days of exercise tests. They discovered that while healthy people's bodies recovered, the metabolism of patients became even more disrupted 24 hours later. This finding helps explain the biological basis of post-exertional malaise and points to specific problems with energy production.

### 2020-02-06 An Isolated Complex V Inefficiency and Dysregulated Mitochondrial Function in Immortalized Lymphocytes from ME/CFS Patients

    - **Publisher:** International Journal of Molecular Sciences
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21031074)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated mitochondrial function and cellular stress signaling pathways in immortalized lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) from ME/CFS patients.  The primary goal was to clarify the nature of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS, given the inconsistent findings in previous research. 
- **Why was it researched?**
Previous studies on mitochondrial function in ME/CFS have produced conflicting results, with some reporting reduced function and others finding no significant changes.  The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies might be due to the use of *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which are metabolically inactive and die more rapidly in samples from ME/CFS patients.  To address this, they used metabolically active, immortalized lymphoblasts as a more stable model to reexamine energy metabolism in ME/CFS. 
- **How was it researched?**
This was an *in vitro* laboratory study analyzing immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from 51 ME/CFS patients and 22 healthy controls.  The researchers used Seahorse extracellular flux analysis to measure mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) and glycolysis.  They also employed whole-cell proteomics and biochemical assays to measure the expression of mitochondrial proteins, steady-state ATP levels, mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and the activity of the TORC1 stress-sensing pathway. 
- **What has been found?**
The study identified an isolated inefficiency in Complex V, the final component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for ATP synthesis.  Although this reduced the efficiency of energy production, ME/CFS cells compensated by upregulating the expression and capacity of other respiratory complexes (I, II, and IV) and increasing their use of fatty acids for fuel.  This compensation successfully maintained normal ATP levels at rest, but was associated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chronically hyperactivated TORC1 stress signaling. 
- **Discussion:**
The authors propose that their use of metabolically active lymphoblasts provides a clearer picture than studies using quiescent *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which they found have a higher death rate in ME/CFS samples and may have confounded previous results.  They suggest the observed Complex V inefficiency is likely due to a dysregulation of its activity rather than a genetic defect.  The overall pattern of changes, including the compensatory upregulation of other mitochondrial components, is distinct from findings in other neurological diseases, suggesting a specific pathological mechanism in ME/CFS. 
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that ME/CFS lymphoblasts exhibit a primary inefficiency in Complex V, leading to a cascade of homeostatic compensations that maintain energy levels in a resting state.  However, because these compensatory pathways are already chronically activated, the cells may be unable to respond to acute increases in energy demand, which could be a cellular basis for post-exertional malaise.  The authors suggest future work should investigate the cause of the Complex V dysfunction and examine whether these findings are replicated in other cell types. 
- **Summary:**
This study identifies a specific problem at the very end of the cellular energy production line (Complex V) in ME/CFS patient immune cells. While the cells successfully compensate for this inefficiency at rest by over-activating other parts of the energy pathway, this state of constant compensation may exhaust their ability to ramp up energy production when needed, such as during physical or mental exertion. This finding provides a potential cellular explanation for post-exertional malaise and other symptoms of energy impairment. By pinpointing a specific molecular inefficiency rather than a general mitochondrial failure, this research offers a more focused target for the development of future diagnostic biomarkers and treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists discovered a specific inefficiency in the final step of energy production within immune cells from ME/CFS patients. The cells work overtime to make up for this problem, keeping energy levels normal when at rest. This constant state of compensation may be why the cells can't produce extra energy when needed, potentially explaining the severe fatigue after exertion.

### 2019-07-04 Post-Exertional Malaise Is Associated with Hypermetabolism, Hypoacetylation and Purine Metabolism Deregulation in ME/CFS Cases

- **Metadata:**
    - **Authors:** Neil R. McGregor, Christopher W. Armstrong, Donald P. Lewis, Paul R. Gooley
    - **Institutes:** Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biochemistry Institute; CFS Discovery, Donvale Medical Centre.
    - **Publisher:** Diagnostics
    - **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics9030070)
- **What was researched?**
This study investigated the biochemical changes in the blood and urine of ME/CFS patients to identify metabolic signatures associated with the severity of post-exertional malaise (PEM) experienced in the previous seven days. The researchers aimed to understand the underlying pathophysiology of PEM, a core symptom of the illness.
- **Why was it researched?**
While PEM is a defining characteristic of ME/CFS, very little is known about its biological basis. Previous research indicated that ME/CFS patients have dysregulated energy metabolism, including problems with glycolysis (breaking down sugar for energy) and purine metabolism (related to ATP, the cell's energy currency). This study was designed to specifically link these previously observed biochemical anomalies to the acute experience of PEM.
- **How was it researched?**
This was an observational study analyzing blood and urine samples from 46 ME/CFS patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The ME/CFS group was further divided into 35 patients who had experienced PEM within the last 7 days (the "PEM group") and 11 who had not. Researchers used questionnaires to score PEM severity and frequency, and metabolomics (the large-scale study of small molecules) to analyze the biochemical differences between the groups.
- **What has been found?**
The study found that the severity of PEM in the last 7 days was associated with a "hypermetabolic event" characterized by the increased excretion of multiple metabolites in the urine. Key findings included increased urinary excretion of methylhistidine (a marker for muscle protein breakdown), mannitol (a marker for intestinal barrier dysfunction or "leaky gut"), and acetate. The primary biochemical change linked to PEM severity was a significant drop in the serum level of hypoxanthine, a crucial component of purine metabolism needed for energy production. These findings point towards a state of hypoacetylation (low acetate availability) and dysregulated energy production during PEM.
- **Discussion:**
The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the small study size and the potential for recall bias from using self-reported symptom questionnaires. The study was designed as an exploratory investigation to generate a hypothesis, rather than to test a pre-existing one. Therefore, the findings need to be confirmed in larger, multi-center studies that can further validate the identified biochemical changes.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that PEM is associated with significant disruptions in glycolysis, acetylation, and purine metabolism. This suggests a state of hypoacetylation occurs, which can profoundly impact cellular functions, including gene expression and enzyme activity. The researchers call for future studies to directly evaluate acetylation processes and their consequences in ME/CFS patients to better understand the mechanisms of PEM and develop appropriate therapies.
- **Summary:**
This research provides a potential biological explanation for the "crash" experienced during PEM. It suggests that exertion triggers a hypermetabolic state in ME/CFS patients, causing their bodies to wastefully excrete vital moleculesâ€”including those needed for cellular regulation (acetate) and energy (purines)â€”through their urine. This process is linked to evidence of muscle breakdown and leaky gut. The resulting lack of key molecules like acetate (hypoacetylation) could disrupt a vast range of cellular activities, offering a reason for the widespread symptoms of PEM. These findings offer specific biochemical targets for future research into diagnostics and treatments and provide a scientific basis for why graded exercise may be physically harmful for patients.
- **Simple Summary:**
Scientists found that after exertion, the bodies of ME/CFS patients go into an overdrive state, causing them to lose key molecules through their urine. This process appears to be connected to muscle breakdown, leaky gut, and problems with how cells produce energy. These findings help explain the biological cause of post-exertional malaise and show why pushing through activity could be physically damaging.

### 2015-02-10 Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness

- **Metadata:**

    - **Institutes:** Committee on the Diagnostic Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; Board on the Health of Select Populations; Institute of Medicine.
    - **Publisher:** The National Academies Press
    - **Link:** [Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274235/)
- **What was researched?**
This Institute of Medicine (IOM) report outlines the work of an expert committee charged with evaluating the numerous existing diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Based on a comprehensive evidence review, the committee's objective was to develop new, evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria, recommend whether a new name for the illness was warranted, and propose a strategy for disseminating their findings to healthcare professionals. 
- **Why was it researched?**
The study was commissioned because diagnosing ME/CFS is a persistent challenge, leading to long delays and a high rate of undiagnosed patients, estimated to be between 84 and 91 percent. Existing case definitions were numerous, varied, and often conflicting, causing confusion for clinicians and researchers. This situation, coupled with skepticism in the medical community, prompted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with the IOM to develop clearer, consensus-based criteria to improve the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis and patient care. 
- **How was it researched?**
This was a consensus study based on a comprehensive literature review. The IOM convened a 15-member committee with expertise in ME/CFS and related fields. The committee systematically reviewed scientific literature published since 1950, heard testimony from patients, advocates, and scientific experts, and considered hundreds of public comments. An adapted "GRADE grid" was used to formally assess the evidence for various symptoms, and the final recommendations for new diagnostic criteria were reached through a consensus-building methodology among the entire committee. 
- **What has been found?**
The committee proposed new, more focused diagnostic criteria requiring three core symptoms: 1) a substantial reduction in pre-illness activity levels lasting more than 6 months, accompanied by profound, new-onset fatigue not alleviated by rest; 2) post-exertional malaise (PEM); and 3) unrefreshing sleep. In addition, a diagnosis requires at least one of two other manifestations: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. The committee also concluded that the name "chronic fatigue syndrome" is stigmatizing and trivializing, and that "myalgic encephalomyelitis" is not well supported by evidence; they recommended renaming the illness "systemic exertion intolerance disease" (SEID). 
- **Discussion:**
The committee noted that a significant challenge in their work was the methodological limitations of the existing ME/CFS research base. They highlighted the heterogeneity in patient and control groups across studies, the use of many different and sometimes unvalidated measures for symptoms, and the lack of properly matched control groups (e.g., patients with other fatiguing illnesses). The committee was also struck by the overall paucity of research funding and studies conducted to date, which limited their ability to define disease subgroups or the natural history of the illness. 
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The committee concluded that ME/CFS is a serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease and that their proposed evidence-based criteria will enable clinicians to make more accurate and timely diagnoses. They recommended that a multidisciplinary group should reexamine and update these new criteria in no more than 5 years, as new research becomes available. The report emphasizes that more research is essential to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of the disease. 
- **Summary:**
This landmark report from the Institute of Medicine provides strong validation for the severity and legitimacy of ME/CFS, directly addressing the skepticism that patients often face. By proposing new diagnostic criteria centered on core, debilitating symptoms like post-exertional malaise, it provides clinicians with a clearer path to diagnosis, potentially reducing the years-long diagnostic delays many patients endure. The recommendation to rename the illness "systemic exertion intolerance disease" (SEID) is a direct attempt to reduce stigma and better reflect the central role of exertion intolerance in the disease's pathology. For patients, this report represents a crucial step toward improved medical recognition, more accurate diagnoses, and a stronger foundation for future research into treatments.
- **Simple Summary:**
A major U.S. medical institute has confirmed that ME/CFS is a serious and complex physical illness. They have created new, clearer diagnostic rules for doctors that focus on core symptoms like the severe worsening of symptoms after minimal exertion. The experts also recommended changing the name to "systemic exertion intolerance disease" to better describe the condition and reduce stigma.
