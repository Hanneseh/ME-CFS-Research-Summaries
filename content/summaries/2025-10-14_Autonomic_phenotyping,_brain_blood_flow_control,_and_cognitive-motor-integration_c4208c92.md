## Summary

This study is significant because it provides objective evidence that ME/CFS and Long COVID may not be the same condition at a physiological level, despite their outward similarities. For patients, this suggests that the "brain fog" and cognitive difficulties in ME/CFS may be directly linked to how the brain regulates its own blood supply during metabolic stress. Meanwhile, the findings in Long COVID suggest a different problem related to maintaining oxygen levels and heart-rhythm balance while upright. While these results are preliminary due to the small number of participants, they offer a path toward more precise diagnostic testing that could eventually move beyond symptom checklists to objective physical measurements.

## What was researched?

This pilot study aimed to identify whether ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit distinct physiological "phenotypes" (observable characteristics) despite their similar symptoms. Researchers specifically focused on how the autonomic nervous system and brain blood flow control react to stressors like low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, and standing upright.

## Why was it researched?

While ME/CFS and Long COVID share many clinical features—such as fatigue, brain fog, and autonomic dysfunction—it is unclear if they share the same underlying biological mechanisms. Because an increasing number of Long COVID patients are meeting the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, understanding the specific physiological differences between these groups is essential for improving diagnosis and developing targeted management strategies.

## How was it researched?

In this laboratory-based pilot study, researchers recruited 31 participants: 12 with mild/moderate ME/CFS, 9 with Long COVID (symptoms for >3 months), and 10 sedentary healthy controls. Participants underwent three specific tests: breathing a 5% carbon dioxide mixture (hypercapnia), breathing a 10% oxygen mixture (hypoxia), and a 5-minute 70° head-up tilt test to simulate standing. Throughout these trials, the team monitored respiratory, hemodynamic (blood flow), and cerebrovascular (brain blood vessel) variables, alongside assessments of resting vascular function and cognitive-motor integration (the brain's ability to coordinate thought and movement).

## What has been found?

The study found that while both patient groups had similar resting vascular function to healthy controls, they displayed unique physiological responses under stress. Patients with ME/CFS showed a significantly greater reduction in cerebrovascular resistance and impaired autoregulation in the brain when carbon dioxide levels were high, which coincided with impaired cognitive-motor integration. In contrast, patients with Long COVID experienced lower peripheral and end-tidal oxygen levels and a reduced "vagal withdrawal" (a specific parasympathetic nervous system response) while standing upright during the tilt test.

## Discussion

The authors note that these findings point toward distinct underlying causes for the symptoms in each group, with Long COVID appearing more related to oxygenation issues while standing and ME/CFS involving impaired control of blood flow within the brain. The study is limited by its small sample size, which characterizes it as a "pilot" investigation, and the results may be influenced by the duration of the participants' illnesses or the specific nature of the COVID-19 virus.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that ME/CFS and Long COVID represent unique physiological phenotypes, suggesting that different mechanisms drive their shared symptoms. Future research with larger patient cohorts is needed to confirm these findings and determine if these specific patterns of brain blood flow and oxygenation can be used as reliable diagnostic biomarkers or to tailor treatments for each condition.
