## Summary

This landmark report from the Institute of Medicine provides strong validation for the severity and legitimacy of ME/CFS, directly addressing the skepticism that patients often face. By proposing new diagnostic criteria centered on core, debilitating symptoms like post-exertional malaise, it provides clinicians with a clearer path to diagnosis, potentially reducing the years-long diagnostic delays many patients endure. The recommendation to rename the illness "systemic exertion intolerance disease" (SEID) is a direct attempt to reduce stigma and better reflect the central role of exertion intolerance in the disease's pathology. For patients, this report represents a crucial step toward improved medical recognition, more accurate diagnoses, and a stronger foundation for future research into treatments.

## What was researched?

This Institute of Medicine (IOM) report outlines the work of an expert committee charged with evaluating the numerous existing diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Based on a comprehensive evidence review, the committee's objective was to develop new, evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria, recommend whether a new name for the illness was warranted, and propose a strategy for disseminating their findings to healthcare professionals.

## Why was it researched?

The study was commissioned because diagnosing ME/CFS is a persistent challenge, leading to long delays and a high rate of undiagnosed patients, estimated to be between 84 and 91 percent. Existing case definitions were numerous, varied, and often conflicting, causing confusion for clinicians and researchers. This situation, coupled with skepticism in the medical community, prompted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with the IOM to develop clearer, consensus-based criteria to improve the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis and patient care.

## How was it researched?

This was a consensus study based on a comprehensive literature review. The IOM convened a 15-member committee with expertise in ME/CFS and related fields. The committee systematically reviewed scientific literature published since 1950, heard testimony from patients, advocates, and scientific experts, and considered hundreds of public comments. An adapted "GRADE grid" was used to formally assess the evidence for various symptoms, and the final recommendations for new diagnostic criteria were reached through a consensus-building methodology among the entire committee.

## What has been found?

The committee proposed new, more focused diagnostic criteria requiring three core symptoms: 1) a substantial reduction in pre-illness activity levels lasting more than 6 months, accompanied by profound, new-onset fatigue not alleviated by rest; 2) post-exertional malaise (PEM); and 3) unrefreshing sleep. In addition, a diagnosis requires at least one of two other manifestations: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. The committee also concluded that the name "chronic fatigue syndrome" is stigmatizing and trivializing, and that "myalgic encephalomyelitis" is not well supported by evidence; they recommended renaming the illness "systemic exertion intolerance disease" (SEID).

## Discussion

The committee noted that a significant challenge in their work was the methodological limitations of the existing ME/CFS research base. They highlighted the heterogeneity in patient and control groups across studies, the use of many different and sometimes unvalidated measures for symptoms, and the lack of properly matched control groups (e.g., patients with other fatiguing illnesses). The committee was also struck by the overall paucity of research funding and studies conducted to date, which limited their ability to define disease subgroups or the natural history of the illness.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The committee concluded that ME/CFS is a serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease and that their proposed evidence-based criteria will enable clinicians to make more accurate and timely diagnoses. They recommended that a multidisciplinary group should reexamine and update these new criteria in no more than 5 years, as new research becomes available. The report emphasizes that more research is essential to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of the disease.

## Summary

This research provides a potential biological explanation for the "crash" experienced during PEM. It suggests that exertion triggers a hypermetabolic state in ME/CFS patients, causing their bodies to wastefully excrete vital molecules—including those needed for cellular regulation (acetate) and energy (purines)—through their urine. This process is linked to evidence of muscle breakdown and leaky gut. The resulting lack of key molecules like acetate (hypoacetylation) could disrupt a vast range of cellular activities, offering a reason for the widespread symptoms of PEM. These findings offer specific biochemical targets for future research into diagnostics and treatments and provide a scientific basis for why graded exercise may be physically harmful for patients.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the biochemical changes in the blood and urine of ME/CFS patients to identify metabolic signatures associated with the severity of post-exertional malaise (PEM) experienced in the previous seven days. The researchers aimed to understand the underlying pathophysiology of PEM, a core symptom of the illness.

## Why was it researched?

While PEM is a defining characteristic of ME/CFS, very little is known about its biological basis. Previous research indicated that ME/CFS patients have dysregulated energy metabolism, including problems with glycolysis (breaking down sugar for energy) and purine metabolism (related to ATP, the cell's energy currency). This study was designed to specifically link these previously observed biochemical anomalies to the acute experience of PEM.

## How was it researched?

This was an observational study analyzing blood and urine samples from 46 ME/CFS patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The ME/CFS group was further divided into 35 patients who had experienced PEM within the last 7 days (the "PEM group") and 11 who had not. Researchers used questionnaires to score PEM severity and frequency, and metabolomics (the large-scale study of small molecules) to analyze the biochemical differences between the groups.

## What has been found?

The study found that the severity of PEM in the last 7 days was associated with a "hypermetabolic event" characterized by the increased excretion of multiple metabolites in the urine. Key findings included increased urinary excretion of methylhistidine (a marker for muscle protein breakdown), mannitol (a marker for intestinal barrier dysfunction or "leaky gut"), and acetate. The primary biochemical change linked to PEM severity was a significant drop in the serum level of hypoxanthine, a crucial component of purine metabolism needed for energy production. These findings point towards a state of hypoacetylation (low acetate availability) and dysregulated energy production during PEM.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the small study size and the potential for recall bias from using self-reported symptom questionnaires. The study was designed as an exploratory investigation to generate a hypothesis, rather than to test a pre-existing one. Therefore, the findings need to be confirmed in larger, multi-center studies that can further validate the identified biochemical changes.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that PEM is associated with significant disruptions in glycolysis, acetylation, and purine metabolism. This suggests a state of hypoacetylation occurs, which can profoundly impact cellular functions, including gene expression and enzyme activity. The researchers call for future studies to directly evaluate acetylation processes and their consequences in ME/CFS patients to better understand the mechanisms of PEM and develop appropriate therapies.

## Summary

This study identifies a specific problem at the very end of the cellular energy production line (Complex V) in ME/CFS patient immune cells. While the cells successfully compensate for this inefficiency at rest by over-activating other parts of the energy pathway, this state of constant compensation may exhaust their ability to ramp up energy production when needed, such as during physical or mental exertion. This finding provides a potential cellular explanation for post-exertional malaise and other symptoms of energy impairment. By pinpointing a specific molecular inefficiency rather than a general mitochondrial failure, this research offers a more focused target for the development of future diagnostic biomarkers and treatments.

## What was researched?

This study investigated mitochondrial function and cellular stress signaling pathways in immortalized lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) from ME/CFS patients.  The primary goal was to clarify the nature of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS, given the inconsistent findings in previous research.

## Why was it researched?

Previous studies on mitochondrial function in ME/CFS have produced conflicting results, with some reporting reduced function and others finding no significant changes.  The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies might be due to the use of *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which are metabolically inactive and die more rapidly in samples from ME/CFS patients.  To address this, they used metabolically active, immortalized lymphoblasts as a more stable model to reexamine energy metabolism in ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This was an *in vitro* laboratory study analyzing immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from 51 ME/CFS patients and 22 healthy controls.  The researchers used Seahorse extracellular flux analysis to measure mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) and glycolysis.  They also employed whole-cell proteomics and biochemical assays to measure the expression of mitochondrial proteins, steady-state ATP levels, mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and the activity of the TORC1 stress-sensing pathway.

## What has been found?

The study identified an isolated inefficiency in Complex V, the final component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for ATP synthesis.  Although this reduced the efficiency of energy production, ME/CFS cells compensated by upregulating the expression and capacity of other respiratory complexes (I, II, and IV) and increasing their use of fatty acids for fuel.  This compensation successfully maintained normal ATP levels at rest, but was associated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chronically hyperactivated TORC1 stress signaling.

## Discussion

The authors propose that their use of metabolically active lymphoblasts provides a clearer picture than studies using quiescent *ex vivo* lymphocytes, which they found have a higher death rate in ME/CFS samples and may have confounded previous results.  They suggest the observed Complex V inefficiency is likely due to a dysregulation of its activity rather than a genetic defect.  The overall pattern of changes, including the compensatory upregulation of other mitochondrial components, is distinct from findings in other neurological diseases, suggesting a specific pathological mechanism in ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS lymphoblasts exhibit a primary inefficiency in Complex V, leading to a cascade of homeostatic compensations that maintain energy levels in a resting state.  However, because these compensatory pathways are already chronically activated, the cells may be unable to respond to acute increases in energy demand, which could be a cellular basis for post-exertional malaise.  The authors suggest future work should investigate the cause of the Complex V dysfunction and examine whether these findings are replicated in other cell types.

## Summary

This study provides strong, objective evidence for the biological reality of post-exertional malaise. It shows that the bodies of people with ME/CFS do not just respond differently to exercise but, more importantly, fail to recover properly on a metabolic level, with abnormalities worsening 24 hours later. The research points to a central disruption in how the body manages energy and building blocks, with glutamate-related pathways emerging as a key area of dysfunction. While not identifying a simple diagnostic test, this work demonstrates that a dynamic stress test is far more revealing than a static one and opens new avenues for understanding and potentially treating the metabolic chaos that follows exertion in ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the changes in 1,157 plasma metabolites in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls in response to an exercise challenge. The researchers monitored these changes before and after two maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by 24 hours, a protocol specifically designed to provoke post-exertional malaise (PEM) in patients.

## Why was it researched?

PEM is a hallmark symptom of ME/CFS, yet its underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. While previous studies have analyzed the metabolome of ME/CFS patients at rest, none had tracked the metabolic changes over time following a standardized exercise stressor intended to induce PEM. This research aimed to identify the specific metabolic disruptions that occur during the response to and recovery from exertion.

## How was it researched?

This was a longitudinal study analyzing blood samples from 60 ME/CFS patients and 45 healthy, sedentary controls. Participants performed two maximal-effort CPETs on a stationary bike, 24 hours apart. Plasma samples were collected at four key time points: before and after exercise on day 1, and before and after exercise on day 2. The relative levels of 1,157 metabolites were then measured and analyzed using advanced statistical and pathway analysis methods to compare the metabolic response and recovery patterns between the two groups.

## What has been found?

The study found that the metabolic differences between ME/CFS patients and controls became more pronounced after the exercise challenges. The 24-hour recovery period was particularly abnormal in the ME/CFS cohort, with over a quarter of the identified metabolic pathways being statistically different from controls. Many of these disrupted pathways, including those for lipids and energy, appeared to be connected through glutamate metabolism. The study also highlighted that a large percentage of the most significantly different metabolites between groups were of unknown chemical identity.

## Discussion

The authors note that their findings at baseline are consistent with previous ME/CFS metabolomics literature, which has pointed to dysregulation in amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism. The study's strength lies in its longitudinal design using an exercise stressor, which revealed accumulating metabolic disturbances not apparent in a resting state. A noted limitation was the small size of the male cohort, which hindered the statistical power to draw firm conclusions about sex-specific differences, although trends were observed.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS patients exhibit a profoundly disrupted metabolic response and recovery following exertion, providing insight into the molecular changes that likely contribute to PEM. Future work requires large-scale studies to confirm these findings and to identify the unknown metabolites that were significantly altered, which may play a critical role in the disease's mechanisms.

## Summary

This paper offers a unifying theory that places malfunctioning brain immune cells, known as neuroglia, at the center of ME/CFS pathology. It suggests these cells are stuck in a hyper-reactive state, providing a potential biological reason for post-exertional malaise and the widespread problems with brain blood flow. This "neuroglial failure" hypothesis does not dismiss other findings like mitochondrial or vascular issues, but rather proposes a central mechanism in the brain that connects them. This provides a valuable framework that could help guide future research toward developing treatments that specifically target the neuro-immune interface of the central nervous system.

## What was researched?

This paper explores the hypothesis that a dysfunction of neuroglia—the support and immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) such as astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes—could be the common underlying cause for the wide range of biological abnormalities observed in ME/CFS. The authors reviewed existing scientific literature to test whether this "neuroglial failure" model could explain the two most defining features of the illness: post-exertional malaise (PEM) and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF).

## Why was it researched?

While numerous potential disease mechanisms for ME/CFS have been identified, including immune, metabolic, and vascular problems, it remains unclear how these different pathways are connected. Glial cell dysfunction has been previously suggested as a key feature of ME/CFS, but a comprehensive review was lacking. This paper aimed to provide a unifying hypothesis that could connect these disparate findings into a single, cohesive pathobiological framework.

## How was it researched?

This study was a hypothesis and theory paper based on a non-systematic literature review. The authors analyzed and synthesized existing research on the clinical and pathobiological features of ME/CFS. They focused specifically on whether the core characteristics of PEM and abnormal CBF could be mechanistically explained by the known functions and dysfunctions of neuroglial cells.

## What has been found?

The review concludes that neuroglial dysfunction provides a plausible explanation for the core features of ME/CFS. The authors propose that in ME/CFS, neuroglial cells exist in a "primed" or hyper-reactive state, which would explain the delayed onset, prolonged duration, and multi-systemic nature of PEM as a response to various stressors. Furthermore, since glial cells are central to regulating blood flow in the brain through neurovascular coupling and the baroreflex, their dysfunction would directly account for the consistently observed deficits in cerebral blood flow.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations to their hypothesis that require further investigation. The presence of CNS inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in ME/CFS has not yet been definitively proven. Additionally, the specific roles and interactions of the different glial cell populations (microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) in the disease process remain to be defined.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that regulatory failure of the CNS due to dysfunctional neuroglia may be the central process that orchestrates the clinical presentation of ME/CFS. This model links peripheral issues like immune and endothelial dysfunction to a central mechanism. The authors propose a greater research focus on the role of neuroglia in ME/CFS and suggest re-examining existing therapies that may target these cells, such as minocycline 💊, aripiprazole 💊, and low dose naltrexone 💊.

## Summary

This study provides strong evidence for a specific physiological problem in ME/CFS known as "preload failure," where impaired blood vessel function reduces blood return to the heart during exercise. The drug pyridostigmine 💊 appears to temporarily correct this issue, leading to improved exercise capacity. Importantly, the worsening performance of the placebo group on the second test offers an objective measurement that mirrors the clinical phenomenon of post-exertional malaise. This research identifies a key mechanism of the disease and points to a class of existing drugs that could be further investigated as a potential treatment.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether a single 60mg dose of pyridostigmine 💊, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, could acutely improve exercise tolerance in ME/CFS patients. Researchers measured changes in peak oxygen uptake ($VO_{2}$ max) and other cardiovascular functions during back-to-back invasive exercise tests.

## Why was it researched?

The study was motivated by the observation that about one-third of ME/CFS patients have small fiber neuropathy (SFN), which can cause neurovascular dysregulation. The researchers hypothesized that impaired blood vessel constriction during upright exercise reduces blood flow back to the heart and creates a mismatch between blood supply and muscle demand, and that pyridostigmine 💊 could correct this by improving vascular regulation.

## How was it researched?

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 45 ME/CFS patients, of whom 39 (all women) were included in the final analysis. All participants first underwent an invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET) to confirm low filling pressures in the heart. Eligible subjects were then randomly and blindly given either 60mg of pyridostigmine 💊 or a placebo, followed by a second iCPET after a 50-minute rest period to assess the drug's effect.

## What has been found?

The group receiving pyridostigmine 💊 showed a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption ($VO_{2}$ max) during the second exercise test compared to the placebo group. In the treatment group, key measures of cardiovascular function like oxygen uptake ($VO_{2}$), cardiac output (Qt), and right atrial pressure (RAP) increased significantly from the first test to the second, whereas these measures tended to decrease in the placebo group, indicating a worsening of function after the first exertion.

## Discussion

As an abstract, the paper does not contain a detailed discussion of limitations. However, it notes that while 38% of subjects had objective evidence of small fiber neuropathy (SFN), there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of SFN between the treatment and placebo groups, suggesting the drug's beneficial effects may not be exclusive to patients with confirmed SFN.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that these findings suggest neurovascular dysregulation is a fundamental cause of acute exercise intolerance in ME/CFS. The study also provides new evidence that prior exertion worsens this vascular dysregulation, offering a physiological insight into post-exertional malaise (PEM), a hallmark symptom of the disease.

## Summary

This study provides the first direct, non-invasive evidence of a "sodium overload" in the muscles of ME/CFS patients. This finding supports the theory that impaired blood flow and cellular energy production lead to an inability of muscle cells to properly regulate electrolytes. This excess sodium, which worsens after even brief exertion, was directly linked to reduced muscle strength and offers a plausible biological explanation for key symptoms like muscle pain, weakness, and post-exertional malaise. Although this was a very small pilot study, it successfully demonstrates a new method for observing a key pathological process in ME/CFS and strengthens the case for targeting ion channel dysfunction in future treatment research.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to assess and compare the sodium content in the lower leg muscles of patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls.  The researchers measured sodium levels both at rest (baseline) and over a 40-minute period following a brief, standardized leg exercise, and correlated these findings with handgrip strength.

## Why was it researched?

Muscle fatigue and pain are core symptoms of ME/CFS.  Previous evidence points towards hypoperfusion (reduced blood flow) in ME/CFS, which is hypothesized to cause an electrolyte imbalance, specifically an overload of sodium in the muscles.  This study was designed to directly test this hypothesis by non-invasively measuring muscle sodium content.

## How was it researched?

This was a small pilot study involving six female ME/CFS patients and six age, BMI, and sex-matched healthy controls.  The researchers used a specialized magnetic resonance imaging technique (${}^{23}Na$-MRI) on a clinical 3T scanner to quantify sodium content in five different muscle compartments of the left lower leg.  Measurements were taken before and repeatedly for 40 minutes after a 3-minute anaerobic plantar flexion exercise (heel raises), and handgrip strength was also assessed.

## What has been found?

At baseline, ME/CFS patients had significantly higher tissue sodium content in all five lower leg muscle compartments compared to healthy controls.  Following exercise, sodium content increased in both groups, but the increase was more pronounced and the recovery was slower in the ME/CFS group.  Patients also exhibited reduced handgrip strength, and there was a significant inverse correlation: higher average muscle sodium content was associated with lower handgrip strength.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation of this research is its very small sample size, as it was a preliminary pilot study.  They also note that the results may have been influenced by the baseline immobility of the patients and potential variations in exercise intensity, which could be better controlled in future studies using an MRI-compatible exercise apparatus.  The specific MRI protocol used was better at measuring extracellular sodium, and the authors recommend different techniques for future studies to more accurately differentiate between intracellular and extracellular sodium.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that ${}^{23}Na$-MRI confirms the hypothesis of increased sodium content in the muscles of ME/CFS patients, both at rest and after exercise.  These findings provide evidence that sodium overload may play a role in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS and could open up new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.  The authors state that these encouraging results warrant further research with larger patient populations and refined methodologies.

## Summary

This comprehensive review suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a promising treatment for fibromyalgia, offering significant pain relief and improvements in fatigue, sleep, and overall function. The therapy appears to be generally safe, with the most common side effects being mild, reversible ear pressure issues that might be reduced by using lower-pressure protocols. While the evidence is encouraging, the authors highlight that it is based on a small number of studies. This research reinforces the potential of HBOT as a non-invasive option for FM, warranting larger, more rigorous clinical trials to confirm its benefits and establish standardized treatment guidelines.

## What was researched?

This study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for treating the core symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), such as pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.

## Why was it researched?

Fibromyalgia is an incurable chronic condition for which current treatments often provide only moderate or temporary relief and can cause significant side effects. Accumulating evidence suggests HBOT, a non-invasive therapy, may be an effective treatment, but previous reviews lacked sufficient evidence and a formal meta-analysis to confirm its benefits and safety for FM.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. Researchers searched multiple scientific databases for studies on HBOT for FM published up to October 2022. They identified and analyzed nine studies (three randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized controlled trials) involving a total of 288 patients. A meta-analysis was performed on the data for pain relief from the three randomized trials, while other outcomes were analyzed descriptively.

## What has been found?

The meta-analysis showed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) 💊 significantly relieved pain in FM patients compared to control interventions. Most of the included studies also reported that HBOT improved other core symptoms, including tender points, fatigue, multidimensional function, overall patient well-being, and sleep disturbance. Adverse events, most commonly mild and reversible barotrauma (ear pressure issues), occurred in 23.8% of patients receiving HBOT, with 6.5% withdrawing due to side effects; no serious adverse events were reported.

## Discussion

The authors identify the primary limitation as the small number of randomized controlled trials included, which could lead to bias or insufficient evidence. They also note that the clinical heterogeneity in HBOT protocols (e.g., treatment duration and pressure levels) across the studies may have influenced the results. The authors speculate that FM patients may have a lower pain threshold and be more sensitive to discomfort, which could explain the higher rate of adverse events compared to rates reported in other diseases.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that HBOT may have a positive effect on improving pain and other core symptoms of FM, with reversible side effects. They suggest that using lower pressure (less than 2.0 atmospheric absolute) may be beneficial for reducing adverse events. The study calls for further high-quality, large-sample randomized controlled trials to better evaluate HBOT's efficacy, safety, and optimal treatment protocol for FM.

## Summary

This study provides preliminary but highly encouraging evidence for H.E.L.P. apheresis as a treatment for Long COVID. The research supports the theory that persistent microclots and inflammation play a key role in the illness by demonstrating that physically filtering these components from the blood can lead to dramatic and lasting clinical improvements. For patients, this suggests a potential, tangible treatment that addresses an underlying biological mechanism, though it is still experimental and not widely available. The overwhelmingly positive results in this small group strongly justify the larger, controlled clinical trials needed to confirm these findings and potentially establish this as a standard of care.

## What was researched?

This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a blood filtration procedure called Heparin-mediated Extracorporeal Low-density lipoprotein Precipitation (H.E.L.P.) apheresis as a potential treatment for patients with severe, persistent Long COVID symptoms. The research aimed to assess if repeated treatments could lead to clinical recovery and long-term functional improvement.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a debilitating condition with no proven effective treatments, and there is growing evidence that it may be caused by persistent, fibrinolysis-resistant microclots and systemic inflammation that block capillaries and impair oxygen transport to tissues. H.E.L.P. apheresis is a procedure known to remove clotting factors like fibrinogen, inflammatory mediators, and other pathological substances from the blood, making it a plausible therapeutic candidate to address the hypothesized underlying cause of Long COVID symptoms.

## How was it researched?

This was a retrospective pilot study (case series) involving 17 patients (ages 23-63) with a formal diagnosis of Long COVID and severe symptoms lasting 2-12 months. Each participant received between 1 to 7 sessions of H.E.L.P. apheresis. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated using questionnaires to assess symptoms before and after the treatment course, along with a 6-10 month telephonic follow-up. Blood tests for inflammatory and coagulation markers like fibrinogen, D-Dimer, and CRP were also conducted before and after treatments to monitor physiological changes.

## What has been found?

The treatment showed significant positive effects. Of the 17 patients, 16 experienced immediate and substantial improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. After completing their treatment course, 12 patients reported complete or near-complete resolution of all symptoms, returning to their pre-infection baseline. A follow-up at 6-10 months found that these benefits were maintained or had continued to improve in 15 of the patients. Only one patient did not experience symptomatic relief, although their blood oxygen saturation did improve.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that this was a small pilot study without a control group, which is a significant limitation. The lack of a control group was attributed to the high cost and limited availability of H.E.L.P. apheresis machines. They also noted that the optimal number of treatments required is still unknown and may depend on how long a patient has been ill. The authors hypothesize that the observed benefits are primarily due to the removal of circulating microclots and the restoration of normal clotting function and oxygen delivery.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that H.E.L.P. apheresis is a promising and safe treatment option that can significantly reduce clinical symptoms and improve long-term function in patients with Long COVID. They strongly emphasize the urgent need for larger, controlled studies to rigorously evaluate the procedure's efficacy and safety before it can be considered a standard treatment. Future research should also explore its potential use in acute severe COVID-19 and other post-viral illnesses with similar proposed mechanisms, such as ME/CFS.

## Summary

This is a landmark study as it is the first large-scale randomized trial to show that an existing, safe, and low-cost medication can prevent Long COVID. The findings suggest that taking metformin 💊 early during a COVID-19 infection could cut the risk of developing long-term symptoms by over 40%. This provides a potential and immediately actionable strategy to mitigate the long-term public health burden of COVID-19, though further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness across different populations, such as those who are vaccinated or not overweight.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether early outpatient treatment for acute COVID-19 with one of three medications—metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine—could reduce the incidence of a subsequent diagnosis of post-COVID-19 condition (Long COVID) over a 10-month follow-up period.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a significant and emerging public health crisis, yet few randomized trials have assessed whether early treatments for the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can prevent its long-term consequences. This research was motivated by the urgent need to find a safe, affordable, and globally available intervention to reduce the risk of developing this chronic condition.

## How was it researched?

This was a large, remote (decentralised), randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted in the USA. The study included 1,126 adults aged 30-85 with overweight or obesity who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms for less than a week. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either metformin 💊, ivermectin, fluvoxamine, or a matching placebo, and were followed for up to 300 days to see if they received a Long COVID diagnosis from a medical provider.

## What has been found?

Early outpatient treatment with metformin 💊 significantly reduced the incidence of Long COVID. The cumulative incidence of a Long COVID diagnosis by day 300 was 6.3% in the metformin group compared to 10.4% in the placebo group, representing a 41% reduction in risk. The beneficial effect was even stronger when metformin was started within three days of symptom onset. In contrast, neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed any effect on reducing the incidence of Long COVID compared to placebo.

## Discussion

The authors note that a major strength of the study is its randomized, quadruple-blind design, which limits potential bias. A limitation is the potential for selection bias, as trial participants may not represent the general population. The study also excluded adults with a normal BMI or those under 30, so it is unknown if the findings apply to these groups.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that early outpatient treatment with metformin during an acute COVID-19 infection effectively reduces the risk of developing Long COVID. Fluvoxamine and ivermectin were not effective for this purpose. The researchers suggest future trials are needed to assess therapeutics for Long COVID prevention in other populations, including those who are vaccinated or have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infections.

    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-06-22
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31

## Purpose of the Trial

This trial aims to see if an approved drug called Vericiguat 💊 can relieve profound fatigue and other symptoms in people with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), including those who meet the criteria for ME/CFS. The study is based on the theory that impaired blood flow in small blood vessels contributes to PCS symptoms. Vericiguat is believed to improve this blood flow, which may lead to a reduction in symptoms like fatigue and an improvement in physical function.

## Trial Design & Procedure

- **Duration:** Approximately 18 weeks.
    - **Design:** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants are randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants nor the investigators know who is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo (a substance with no active ingredient).
    - **Groups:** Participants will be split into two groups. One group will receive Vericiguat, and the other group will receive a matching placebo.
    - **Procedure:** The treatment involves taking one oral tablet daily for 10 weeks. The dose will be gradually increased over the first four weeks. After the 10-week treatment period, there will be a 30-day follow-up period.

    - **Status:** Recruiting
    - **Start Date:** 2023-10-01
    - **Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-31

## Purpose of the Trial

This trial is investigating if Methylprednisolone 💊, a well-known immunosuppressant drug, can improve cognitive problems (like memory issues), fatigue, and quality of life in people with Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PCS). The study is based on the idea that some PCS symptoms may be caused by an autoimmune reaction. The goal is to see if suppressing the immune system with this drug offers a therapeutic benefit for these specific symptoms.

## Trial Design & Procedure

- **Duration:** 52 weeks.
    - **Design:** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means participants are randomly assigned to a group, and neither the participants, the investigators, nor the outcome assessors know who is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo (a substance with no active ingredient).

## Summary

This study investigated a blood-filtering treatment called Immunoadsorption to remove potentially harmful autoantibodies in 10 patients with post-COVID ME/CFS. A promising 7 out of 10 patients experienced a significant improvement in their physical function four weeks after treatment, though their reported fatigue levels did not change. This finding supports the idea that the immune system, and specifically these autoantibodies, may contribute to the disease in some individuals. While these early results are encouraging, this was a small, uncontrolled study, and the treatment itself was physically demanding for patients. The study serves as a critical stepping stone, providing the necessary evidence to launch larger, placebo-controlled trials to confirm the treatment's effectiveness.

## What was researched?

This observational study evaluated the efficacy of a treatment called Immunoadsorption (IA) for patients who developed ME/CFS after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary goal was to assess whether this treatment could improve the physical and functional ability of patients who had elevated levels of specific autoantibodies (ß2-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies). This paper presents the interim results from the first ten patients treated in the study.

## Why was it researched?

There is increasing evidence that ME/CFS, particularly after an infection, may have an autoimmune basis. Previous small studies suggested that IA, a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood, was effective in post-infectious ME/CFS. Since autoantibodies against ß2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2 AABs) have been linked to symptom severity in post-COVID ME/CFS, the researchers hypothesized that removing these autoantibodies with IA could be a promising therapeutic approach for this patient group.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective observational study involving ten patients diagnosed with post-COVID ME/CFS who also had elevated ADRB2 autoantibodies. Each patient underwent five sessions of Immunoadsorption (IA) over a ten-day period, a procedure that filters immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the blood plasma. The main outcome was the change in physical function, measured using the SF-36 Physical Function (SF36-PF) questionnaire, assessed four weeks after the treatment. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, and cognitive issues, were also evaluated using standardized scales.

## What has been found?

Four weeks after treatment, seven of the ten patients showed a clinically significant improvement in physical function, with their SF36-PF scores increasing by 10 to 45 points. This improvement was accompanied by a significant reduction in muscle pain and immune-related symptoms in these "responders". Although IA successfully lowered the levels of the targeted autoantibodies in all patients, these levels began to rise again within four weeks. Interestingly, there was no significant change in fatigue scores, and the degree of clinical improvement did not correlate with the reduction in autoantibody levels.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the study's primary limitations are the small number of patients and the lack of a control group. They suggest that the observed benefits may not be solely due to the removal of autoantibodies, as there was no correlation between antibody levels and patient response; other mechanisms, such as effects on the B cells that produce antibodies, might be involved. The authors also note that fatigue often improves later in the recovery process, which might explain why physical function improved while fatigue scores did not.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that these preliminary results provide evidence that Immunoadsorption has efficacy in a subset of patients with post-COVID ME/CFS, supporting the theory that autoantibodies play a role in the disease mechanism. These findings justify moving forward with larger, more definitive studies, including a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sham (placebo) apheresis group and an RCT that combines IA with a B-cell depleting therapy. The study also plans to investigate if repeat IA treatments can lead to longer-lasting remission in patients who initially respond but later decline.

## Summary

This study provides strong, objective evidence supporting the biological basis of symptoms in both ME/CFS and post-COVID. It demonstrates that dysautonomia and small fiber neuropathy are significant, measurable features shared by both illnesses. The confirmation of a high prevalence of POTS, along with physical evidence of damage to small nerve fibers (from delayed heat response times), validates common patient complaints. The finding of a non-length-dependent SFN is a key detail that may help guide future diagnostic efforts and research into the mechanisms of nerve damage in these conditions.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to analyze and compare autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia) and small fiber neuropathy (SFN) in patients with post-COVID condition and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) against a group of healthy controls. The researchers also investigated how these conditions might relate to symptoms like cognitive impairment and fatigue.

## Why was it researched?

Post-COVID condition and ME/CFS share many symptoms, including fatigue, "brain fog," and autonomic issues. Previous research has described both dysautonomia and SFN in these patient groups, and it's hypothesized that these neurological problems could be an underlying cause of the debilitating fatigue. This study sought to systematically compare these factors across both illnesses to better understand their similarities and differences.

## How was it researched?

This was a comparative study involving 87 patients with post-COVID condition, 50 with ME/CFS, and 50 healthy controls. Autonomic function was assessed using hemodynamic tests like the Tilt Table Test, Valsalva maneuver, and deep breathing tests. The presence of SFN was evaluated using Sudoscan, which measures sweat gland function controlled by small nerves, and by testing the nerves' response to heat and cold stimuli (evoked potentials). All participants also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation.

## What has been found?

Both ME/CFS and post-COVID patients exhibited significantly higher heart rates at rest and during standing compared to healthy controls. A high percentage of patients met the criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): 31% of the ME/CFS group and 13.8% of the post-COVID group. Both patient groups showed significantly delayed nerve responses to heat stimuli, suggesting damage to small, unmyelinated C-type nerve fibers. Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients had abnormal Sudoscan results in their hands compared to their feet, indicating a "non-length-dependent" SFN, where the neuropathy is patchy rather than starting at the extremities.

## Discussion

The authors noted several limitations, including unequal sample sizes for the patient groups and a different gender distribution across groups, which could introduce bias. They also pointed out that a surprisingly high number of healthy controls showed some pathological autonomic results, which might have masked some of the differences between the patient and control groups. Despite these limitations, the study is highlighted as the first to directly compare these specific autonomic and neuropathic characteristics across both ME/CFS and post-COVID patient cohorts.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors concluded that both ME/CFS and post-COVID condition are characterized by inappropriate tachycardia, a high prevalence of POTS, and evidence of sensory small fiber neuropathy. They recommend future studies with larger control groups to establish clear pathological thresholds for these tests. The researchers also suggest using additional techniques like corneal confocal microscopy to further assess SFN and analyzing for autoantibodies to explore a potential autoimmune cause for these conditions.

## Summary

This study provides evidence for a specific, measurable dysfunction in the immune systems of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, where key "killer" T-cells (CD8 T-cells) appear exhausted and are unable to function properly. This finding could lead to the development of a standardized, objective blood test to aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, the paper presents preliminary but encouraging results from a small group of patients who used a novel nebulized treatment and experienced significant symptom reduction alongside a partial reversal of this immune dysfunction. While not a cure, this research opens a new avenue for therapies that target immune modulation and oxidative stress, though these findings must be validated in larger clinical trials.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the function of a specific type of immune cell, the CD8 T-cell, in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID compared to healthy individuals. It also retrospectively analyzed whether a nebulized treatment with antioxidant and anti-pathogen properties could improve both this immune cell dysfunction and patient-reported symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS and Long COVID share many symptoms and are often triggered by infections, suggesting they may have a common underlying pathology involving a dysregulated immune system. Researchers hypothesized that an aberrant immune response leads to CD8 T-cell dysfunction, similar to the "T-cell exhaustion" seen in chronic viral infections. This study aimed to identify a specific biomarker for these conditions and explore a potential multi-mechanism treatment targeting oxidative stress and immune dysregulation.

## How was it researched?

The study involved two parts. First, a laboratory analysis was conducted on fresh blood samples from 12 ME/CFS patients, 8 Long COVID patients, and 10 healthy controls to measure CD8 T-cell function via intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Second, it presented a retrospective case series of 8 of these patients (4 ME/CFS, 4 Long COVID) who independently chose to use a nebulized treatment, Inspiritol, for a period of 3-15 months. Researchers reviewed changes in their T-cell function and symptom severity scores over the course of the treatment.

## What has been found?

The study found that CD8 T-cells from both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients had a significantly diminished capacity to produce the cytokines IFNy and TNFa after stimulation compared to healthy controls, confirming a state of immune dysfunction. In the retrospective case series of 8 patients treated with a nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen agent (Inspiritol) 💊, there was an observed improvement in this CD8 T-cell function that occurred in parallel with symptom improvement. On average, these patients reported a 54% decrease in overall symptom severity, and no serious treatment-associated side effects were noted.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the observed CD8 T-cell dysfunction is a fundamental aspect of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, potentially explaining the body's inability to control latent pathogens. They note that the multi-component nature of the nebulized agent, which has antioxidant, anti-pathogen, and immunomodulatory properties, may address several underlying mechanisms of the diseases simultaneously. The primary limitation is the small number of patients in the retrospective, uncontrolled case series, which means the results are preliminary.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that CD8 T-cell dysfunction appears to be a key feature of both ME/CFS and Long COVID, and that this measurement has potential as a diagnostic and treatment-tracking biomarker. The positive results from the retrospective case series, although preliminary, support advancing the nebulized agent into larger, controlled clinical trials to formally evaluate its safety and efficacy for both conditions.

## Summary

This comprehensive review of over three decades of ME/CFS clinical trials provides a critical overview of what has been tested and where research should go next. While no single cure has been found, the paper identifies several promising avenues, including treatments targeting viral infections, immune dysfunction, and cellular energy metabolism, that have shown benefits for at least some patients. The most important contribution of this work is its clear roadmap for improving future research: scientists must conduct larger, better-designed trials on well-defined patient groups and use objective data, like from activity trackers, to prove a treatment works. This approach is essential for moving past the inconsistent results of the past and developing the first evidence-based, approved treatments for ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This paper provides a comprehensive review of clinical trials conducted over the last 33 years for ME/CFS. It synthesizes findings from studies on pharmacological drugs and dietary supplements that target dysfunctions in the immunological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. The review also offers recommendations for designing more effective future clinical trials.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a chronic, debilitating illness with no cure or FDA-approved treatment, and fewer than 5% of patients recover to their pre-illness activity levels. Past recommended treatments like Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) have been removed from guidelines due to evidence refuting their safety and efficacy. This creates an urgent need to evaluate the existing body of clinical trial evidence to identify promising research directions and improve the quality of future studies.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review that evaluates and summarizes past clinical trials in ME/CFS. The authors systematically analyzed studies investigating various interventions, grouping them based on the biological system they aimed to treat (e.g., antivirals for infection, immunosuppressants for autoimmunity). The paper also critically assesses the types of outcome measures used in ME/CFS research, comparing subjective patient-reported questionnaires to objective measurements.

## What has been found?

The review identified several interventions with promising but not yet definitive results that require larger trials. Antivirals like valacyclovir (VACV) 💊, valganciclovir (VGCV) 💊, and artesunate 💊 showed some efficacy in patients with evidence of herpesvirus reactivation. Metabolic supplements such as L-carnitine 💊, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) 💊, NADH 💊, and D-ribose 💊 improved symptoms like fatigue and pain in some studies. Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) 💊 showed promise for improving energy, sleep, and pain in retrospective reports. The immunomodulator rintatolimod 💊 is the only drug to have successfully completed a Phase III trial, showing improved exercise tolerance, but it remains an experimental drug in most countries. Many other interventions, including rituximab and various probiotics, yielded mixed or negative results in larger trials.

## Discussion

The authors highlight significant limitations in past ME/CFS research, particularly the overwhelming reliance on subjective Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). They argue that these questionnaires are prone to bias and may not be reliable or valid in the ME/CFS population, as demonstrated by studies where open-label trials showed positive results that were not replicated in subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The review also notes that many promising findings come from small or open-label studies, emphasizing the need for larger, more rigorous validation.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that rintatolimod is the most successful treatment investigated to date, though it is not widely available. They strongly recommend that future clinical trials be more robustly designed, utilizing stringent case definitions that include post-exertional malaise (PEM) as a core symptom. The paper calls for a shift away from subjective questionnaires toward objective outcome measures, such as accelerometers to monitor physical activity, and suggests that trials should focus on specific, evidence-based patient subgroups to improve the chances of success.

## Summary

This landmark NIH study provides a unified biological explanation for the diverse symptoms of ME/CFS, showing it is a physical illness involving the brain, immune system, and heart. A key takeaway is the concept of "effort preference," where the brain appears unable to properly command the body to use energy, which may explain why patients feel exhausted even when their muscles are technically capable of moving. By identifying specific markers—such as brain activity changes and immune cell imbalances—this research moves the field away from psychological theories and toward targeted, objective treatments. While the study was small and does not immediately provide a cure, it offers the most detailed "map" of the illness to date, validating the experiences of patients and providing a clear path for drug trials.

## What was researched?

This comprehensive study utilized "deep phenotyping" to investigate the biological basis of post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (PI-ME/CFS). Researchers performed an exhaustive array of clinical tests—ranging from brain imaging and metabolic tracking to immune profiling and muscle biopsies—to identify objective biomarkers and underlying disease mechanisms.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS has long lacked clear, objective diagnostic markers, leading to historical skepticism about its biological reality. While previous studies identified isolated abnormalities in the immune system or metabolism, this research aimed to integrate these findings by examining a small, highly characterized group of patients in a controlled clinical environment to understand how these systems interact.

## How was it researched?

The study was an intensive, multi-disciplinary cross-sectional analysis involving 17 patients with PI-ME/CFS and 21 healthy controls. Participants underwent a multi-day in-patient evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center, which included functional MRI (fMRI) scans, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), skin and muscle biopsies, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The researchers also tracked patients in metabolic chambers to monitor 24-hour energy expenditure and used advanced "omics" technologies to study gene expression and the gut microbiome.

## What has been found?

The researchers discovered that ME/CFS is characterized by distinct biological changes, notably a dysfunction in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) of the brain, which affects "effort preference" rather than physical capacity. This suggests the brain's ability to signal the body to exert effort is impaired, possibly due to low levels of catecholamines in the central nervous system. Additionally, the study found chronic immune activation (specifically altered B-cell subsets), evidence of autonomic dysfunction (low heart rate variability), and significant differences in how the disease manifests biologically between men and women.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the study's primary limitation is its small sample size (17 patients), which was necessary for such an intensive depth of testing but limits the generalizability of some findings. They also noted a potential selection bias, as the participants had to be healthy enough to travel to and stay at the NIH for several weeks. However, they emphasize that the extreme consistency of findings across multiple biological systems strengthens the validity of the results.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that PI-ME/CFS is a multi-system biological disorder rooted in immune-mediated brain dysfunction and altered energy management. The authors suggest that future research should focus on the "effort preference" pathways in the brain and investigate whether targeting chronic immune activation can restore normal signaling and alleviate fatigue.

## Summary

This in-depth study of one extremely severe patient suggests that a specific type of immune imbalance, a Th2-dominant response involving mast cells and eosinophils, may drive severe symptoms like cognitive impairment and sensory overload. As the patient's health slightly improved, his immune markers shifted away from this Th2 profile, providing a potential biological explanation for changes in his condition. This finding strengthens the link between ME/CFS and related disorders like Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD). The patient's improvement while taking low-dose Abilify (aripiprazole) 💊 and Cortef (hydrocortisone) 💊, while not proof of efficacy, points toward potential therapeutic avenues targeting neuro-immune pathways that warrant further investigation.

## What was researched?

This study conducted an in-depth, four-year longitudinal investigation of a single, extremely severe ME/CFS patient with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD).  Researchers integrated longitudinal cytokine profiling with extensive health, clinical, pharmaceutical, and textual data to identify biological changes associated with a period of marginal symptom improvement.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS research is complicated by patient heterogeneity and a lack of approved diagnostics, and the most severely ill patients are often excluded from studies.  This research was motivated by the need to understand the immunopathology of severe ME/CFS by focusing on a single patient during a phase of slight improvement, aiming to uncover insights into disease mechanisms, severity, and potential therapeutic strategies.

## How was it researched?

This was an N-of-1 longitudinal case study conducted over four years on an extremely severe, bedridden male ME/CFS patient with HSD.  Researchers collected nine blood samples during a period of marginal health improvement and performed multiplex cytokine profiling.  This biological data was integrated with comprehensive clinical records, medication logs, and textual analysis of the patient's blog posts using natural language processing to identify correlations between molecular changes and symptom severity.

## What has been found?

The study found that the patient's marginal health improvement, particularly in cognitive function and sensory intolerance, correlated with a reduction in Th2-type cytokines and decreased activity of mast cells and eosinophils.  This suggests a Th2-dominant immune profile is associated with greater disease severity in this case.  The analysis also implicated the BCL6 and TP53 pathways in ME/CFS pathology.  The patient's improvement was observed after he began taking low-dose Abilify (aripiprazole) 💊 and increased his dose of Cortef (hydrocortisone) 💊, while the dosage of other medications was reduced.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation is this being a single-patient study (N-of-1), which means the findings may not be generalizable to the broader ME/CFS population.  However, they argue that this deep, longitudinal approach on an extremely severe individual provides invaluable, high-resolution insights often missed in larger cross-sectional studies and highlights the importance of including this cohort in research.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that integrating longitudinal multi-modal data is a valuable approach for understanding ME/CFS.  They suggest that aberrant Th2-type cytokines and synergistic activities between mast cells and eosinophils are significant in ME/CFS pathogenesis, especially in severe cases, and may represent a shared mechanism with comorbidities like HSD and MCAS.  Future research should further explore these immune pathways, the roles of regulators like BCL6 and TP53, and the potential of low-dose drugs with partial agonist activity as treatments.

## Summary

This comprehensive review connects numerous strands of research to build a coherent biological model for post-exertional malaise (PEM). It posits that a combination of impaired microcirculation (poor blood flow in small vessels), damaged mitochondria (cellular energy factories), and a persistently activated immune system creates a vicious cycle where even minimal exertion can lead to a severe crash. This model helps explain the systemic nature of symptoms and why recovery is so prolonged. For patients, this work validates their experience by providing a multi-systemic, biological explanation and points towards specific future therapeutic targets, such as improving endothelial function with supplements like L-arginine 💊, clearing viral reservoirs, or using immunomodulatory drugs, although these remain investigational.

## What was researched?

This review article synthesizes current scientific evidence to explain the underlying mechanisms of physical activity-induced post-exertional malaise (PEM). The authors aimed to build a comprehensive model of the pathophysiology by examining microvascular alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immunometabolic interactions in both Post-COVID Condition (PCC) and ME/CFS.

## Why was it researched?

PEM is a core diagnostic criterion for ME/CFS and a frequent, debilitating symptom in PCC, yet its biological causes remain poorly understood. Given the significant clinical overlap between PCC and ME/CFS, researchers hypothesize a common etiology might explain PEM in both conditions. This review sought to conceptualize the available evidence to improve the understanding of what triggers PEM episodes.

## How was it researched?

This study is a narrative literature review. The authors analyzed and synthesized findings from multiple separate studies focusing on the pathophysiology of PCC and ME/CFS. No new experimental data was generated for this paper.

## What has been found?

The review concludes that patients with PEM exhibit reduced systemic oxygen extraction and impaired mitochondrial function upon physical activity. This is driven by several interconnected issues: microvascular dysfunction (including endothelial damage and the formation of fibrinolysis-resistant microclots), mitochondrial damage in muscle cells, and persistent immune activation, possibly due to viral antigen persistence. These problems force a premature switch to anaerobic metabolism, leading to the buildup of substances like lactate and reactive oxygen species, which in turn triggers further immune activation and exacerbates the underlying pathologies in a vicious cycle.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge a primary limitation is that the paper narratively synthesizes findings from many separate studies with different research focuses. They note that no single study has provided conclusive evidence for one overarching disease etiology, meaning the various pathophysiological observations described (e.g., microclots, mitochondrial dysfunction, immune activation) do not necessarily coexist in every patient.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that PEM results from dysfunctional physiological adaptation to exercise, creating a self-propagating loop where exertion leads to metabolic and ionic disturbances, secondary muscle and mitochondrial damage, and further immune activation. They recommend that future studies should investigate the connections between the immune system, metabolism, and microcirculation to better understand PEM. They also suggest that activity prescriptions for patients must account for these underlying mechanisms to avoid provoking PEM.

## Summary

This review presents a compelling model that places skeletal muscle at the heart of ME/CFS pathophysiology. It argues that during exertion, insufficient blood flow causes a toxic buildup of calcium inside muscle cells, which damages their energy-producing mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage creates the profound energy deficit that defines post-exertional malaise. The process becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, explaining the chronic nature of the illness. This framework provides a concrete biological explanation for the disease's core symptoms and identifies clear, promising targets for future drug development aimed at improving muscle blood flow and protecting mitochondria.

## What was researched?

This review article collects and synthesizes recent scientific evidence to explain the central role of skeletal muscle abnormalities in both Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It proposes a specific biological mechanism to explain how an initial infection can lead to the chronic symptoms of ME/CFS, particularly post-exertional malaise (PEM).

## Why was it researched?

The authors previously hypothesized in 2021 that impaired blood flow (hypoperfusion) to muscles in ME/CFS patients could cause an overload of sodium and calcium within muscle cells, leading to mitochondrial damage. Since then, new experimental studies have provided strong evidence supporting this concept, necessitating an updated review to consolidate these findings and build a more complete picture of the disease's pathophysiology.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review that synthesizes findings from recent experimental research. The authors analyzed data from multiple types of studies, including muscle biopsies before and after exercise, electron microscopy to visualize cellular structures, 23-Na-MRI to measure sodium levels in muscle, and exercise tests that assess metabolic function in patients with PCS and ME/CFS.

## What has been found?

Recent studies provide direct evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and physical damage in the skeletal muscle of ME/CFS patients, particularly in the area just under the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal). This damage, which includes tissue necrosis after exercise, was not observed in non-ME/CFS Post-COVID patients. Furthermore, MRI studies have confirmed elevated sodium levels within the muscle cells of ME/CFS patients, supporting the theory that an exercise-induced ion imbalance (sodium and calcium overload) is the primary cause of the mitochondrial and muscle damage, as other potential causes like viral presence or myositis have been ruled out.

## Discussion

The authors propose that ME/CFS can be understood as an "acquired ischemic mitochondrial myopathy," a muscle disease caused by poor blood flow and mitochondrial damage. They describe a vicious cycle where an initial vascular problem (common in acute COVID-19) triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further impair blood flow, making the condition chronic and self-sustaining. Risk factors like autoantibodies and certain genetic predispositions may explain why only a subset of Post-COVID patients transition to ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a self-reproducing cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle is the central mechanism driving ME/CFS and its hallmark symptoms of exertional intolerance and PEM. They suggest that future treatments should focus on breaking this cycle by improving vascular perfusion and normalizing the ionic imbalance in muscles, rather than targeting the original infection. Promising therapeutic strategies under investigation include drugs that improve blood flow, like Mestinon 💊 and vericiguat 💊, and treatments that neutralize harmful autoantibodies.

## Summary

This study provides encouraging evidence for sonlicromanol, a drug targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. While the initial, short-term placebo-controlled results were mixed, the one-year follow-up showed significant improvements in key symptoms like fatigue, pain, mood, and physical function in patients with a confirmed mitochondrial disease. For the ME/CFS community, this is highly relevant as mitochondrial dysfunction is a leading hypothesis for the illness, and a successful treatment in a related disease could open up a new and important avenue for future ME/CFS research. The promising long-term results and good safety profile justify moving this drug into a larger, more definitive Phase 3 trial.

## What was researched?

This Phase 2b clinical trial program evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the drug sonlicromanol in adults with a specific genetic mitochondrial disease caused by the m.3243A>G mutation. The program consisted of a short-term, placebo-controlled study to select the best dose, followed by a one-year, open-label extension study to assess long-term effects.

## Why was it researched?

Primary mitochondrial diseases are a group of rare conditions with very few approved treatments, creating an urgent need for new therapeutic options. Sonlicromanol 💊 is a promising drug candidate that targets key pathways related to metabolic and inflammatory distress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. A previous, smaller Phase 2a study had already demonstrated that the drug had a favorable safety profile and showed a positive effect on mood and cognition.

## How was it researched?

The study was a two-part Phase 2b trial. The first part was a 28-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 27 patients, who each received two doses of sonlicromanol (50 mg and 100 mg twice daily) and a placebo in a cross-over design. Following this, patients who completed the initial trial were eligible to enter a 52-week open-label extension study, where all 15 participants received 100 mg of sonlicromanol twice daily. Efficacy was measured using a wide range of clinical and patient-reported outcomes assessing cognition, fatigue, mood, pain, and physical function.

## What has been found?

In the short-term randomized trial, sonlicromanol 💊 did not meet its primary goal of improving attention, as measured by the Cogstate IDN test. However, a post-hoc analysis suggested that patients who were more severely affected at baseline did show a significant improvement. This analysis also revealed positive signals for improvements in depression (BDI, HADS-D) and self-reported cognitive failures (CFQ). In the 52-week open-label extension, patients showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvements across multiple areas, including fatigue (NQF), physical quality of life (SF-12 PCS), pain (MPQ), and balance (mini-BESTest). The drug was well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile over the year-long treatment period.

## Discussion

The authors suggest the failure to meet the primary endpoint in the short-term trial could be due to the high variability in symptoms among patients and the multisystemic nature of the disease. They highlight that the positive effects of the drug were more apparent in patients who were more symptomatic at the start of treatment. The paper also notes that the 28-day trial duration was likely too short to capture the full benefits, which became more evident in the 52-week extension study. The main limitation of the extension study is the absence of a placebo group, which makes it challenging to definitively attribute all observed improvements solely to the drug.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a 100 mg twice-daily dose of sonlicromanol is safe, well-tolerated, and shows efficacy in clinically relevant domains for patients with m.3243A>G mitochondrial disease. The findings from this Phase 2b program provide a strong basis for selecting appropriate endpoints and patient populations for a larger, 52-week Phase 3 randomized controlled trial to confirm these benefits.

## Summary

This study provides strong evidence linking a specific genetic defect (a mutation in the ADCK1 gene) to mitochondrial dysfunction and severe symptoms in a patient with ME/CFS. The remarkable, life-changing improvement the patient experienced on a combination of supplements that support cellular energy production (5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone) suggests that her illness was directly tied to this biological issue. While this is a single case, it reinforces the mitochondrial dysfunction theory in ME/CFS and opens a potential path toward personalized medicine, where genetic testing could identify patients who may benefit from therapies that target cellular energy metabolism.

## What was researched?

This case report details the clinical journey of a 35-year-old woman with a long history of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The study investigated a potential genetic cause for her condition by performing a comprehensive exon analysis and documented her response to a treatment aimed at supporting mitochondrial function.

## Why was it researched?

The underlying cause of CFS is unknown, but emerging evidence points towards mitochondrial dysfunction as a key factor. Researchers are looking for specific biological markers and targeted treatments. This case presented an opportunity to explore a potential genetic link to mitochondrial problems in CFS and to assess the effectiveness of therapies designed to improve cellular energy production.

## How was it researched?

This was a single-patient case study. The patient, a 35-year-old Japanese woman with CFS since age 11, had previously failed to respond to conventional treatments. Her symptoms and quality of life were monitored over several years, including tracking her Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scores, while she was treated with supplements intended to enhance mitochondrial function. To investigate a genetic cause, comprehensive exon analysis was performed on the patient and two family members, followed by cDNA sequencing to confirm the functional impact of the identified mutation.

## What has been found?

Genetic analysis identified a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in the ADCK1 gene, which is known to be important for mitochondrial function. The patient experienced significant, dose-dependent improvements in fatigue and daily activities after treatment with oral 5-aminolevulinic acid with sodium ferrous citrate (5-ALA/SFC) 💊 and ubiquinone 💊 (also known as coenzyme Q10). While previous treatment with levocarnitine 💊 had provided some benefit, the combination of 5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone led to a much more substantial and sustained improvement in her condition.

## Discussion

The authors note that the patient's dramatic clinical improvement with mitochondrial-supportive supplements strongly suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction was a key driver of her illness. A limitation of the study is that the father's DNA was unavailable, which prevented the researchers from confirming if the ADCK1 mutation was inherited or occurred spontaneously (*de novo*). It also remains to be conclusively proven that this specific heterozygous mutation is sufficient to cause CFS, though the evidence is highly suggestive.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that this case highlights the importance of considering mitochondrial dysfunction in CFS and supports the potential of combining 5-ALA/SFC and ubiquinone as a therapeutic strategy. The identification of the ADCK1 mutation suggests a genetic predisposition to mitochondrial issues in some CFS cases. The authors recommend further functional studies and family-based investigations to confirm the role of this ADCK1 mutation in CFS.

## Summary

This research provides evidence for a non-drug, non-invasive treatment for POTS, a form of dysautonomia common in post-viral illnesses like Long COVID and sometimes seen in ME/CFS. The study suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve with a simple ear clip device can rebalance the autonomic nervous system, leading to a significant and lasting reduction in the excessive heart rate upon standing that defines POTS. By demonstrating improvements in objective markers like heart rate variability and neuropeptide Y, this study points towards a safe potential therapy that directly targets the underlying autonomic dysfunction.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the potential therapeutic benefits of a non-invasive nerve stimulation technique, called low-level tragus stimulation (LL-TS), for patients experiencing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) following a COVID-19 infection. Researchers examined the effect of this treatment on heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and levels of plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY).

## Why was it researched?

POTS, a form of dysautonomia characterized by an excessive heart rate increase upon standing, is frequently reported in Long COVID. Current treatments for POTS have limited effectiveness and can have significant side effects. The researchers hypothesized that LL-TS, which stimulates the vagus nerve, could help rebalance the autonomic nervous system by increasing parasympathetic ("rest-and-digest") activity and reducing sympathetic ("fight-or-flight") over-activity, thereby improving POTS.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trial involving 57 participants with confirmed post-COVID POTS. Patients were divided into two groups: 31 received genuine LL-TS via an ear clip device, and 26 received a sham (fake) stimulation. The treatment was administered for one hour twice daily for a month. Key measurements, including heart rate changes upon standing, HRV, and plasma NPY levels, were taken at the start of the study, after one month of treatment, and at a one-year follow-up.

## What has been found?

The study found that one month of LL-TS 💊 significantly reduced the excessive heart rate increase that patients experienced upon standing. This improvement was sustained at the one-year follow-up. The treatment also rebalanced the autonomic nervous system, as shown by improved HRV metrics (increased high-frequency power and decreased low-frequency power) during a standing test. Furthermore, LL-TS significantly lowered plasma levels of NPY, a neuropeptide associated with sympathetic nerve activity.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledged several limitations of the study. The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the results. The study focused on physiological measurements like heart rate and did not directly assess the broader range of clinical POTS symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment, headache). Additionally, the absence of a control group of healthy individuals or Long COVID patients without POTS makes it difficult to ascertain if the observed effects are specific to the POTS condition.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that LL-TS is a promising, non-invasive therapeutic approach for improving autonomic imbalance in individuals with POTS after a COVID-19 infection. They recommend that future research should involve larger, more diverse patient populations to confirm these findings. Subsequent studies should also directly assess the impact on clinical symptoms to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment's potential.

## Summary

This new regulation in Austria provides patients with ME/CFS and PAIS, for the first time, with access to a range of health insurance-funded off-label medications. This allows for the targeted treatment of various symptoms such as sleep disorders, mast cell issues, POTS, or circulatory problems. While this is not a cure, it is a crucial step toward improving symptom management and quality of life, and it acknowledges the serious physical nature of these diseases, which requires a cautious and individualized treatment approach.

## What was researched?

The subject is not a research study, but rather the official announcement that in Austria, the costs for a list of specific off-label drugs for the treatment of ME/CFS and post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), such as Post-COVID Syndrome, will be covered by the statutory health insurance funds (ÖGK, BVAEB, SVS).

## Why was it researched?

The aim of this initiative was to provide patients with access to potentially effective drug treatments that were not previously approved for these conditions. Since there are no approved therapies for ME/CFS and PAIS, this regulation is intended to close a gap in symptomatic care and alleviate the burden on those affected.

## How was it researched?

This is a health policy measure based on a collaboration between the Reference Center for Post-Viral Syndromes at the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian social insurance providers. The list was created and approved based on current scientific literature and clinical experience with the successful application of these drugs for symptom improvement.

## What has been found?

An agreement was reached that allows doctors to prescribe a range of off-label medications for the indication of ME/CFS and PAIS, with the costs covered by the insurance funds. The list includes medications for treating sleep-wake cycle disorders (e.g., Melatonin), mast cell activation syndromes (e.g., H1/H2 blockers like Desloratadine 💊, Ketotifen 💊), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (e.g., beta-blockers 💊, Ivabradine 💊, Mestinon 💊), as well as endothelial dysfunction and microthrombi (e.g., statins 💊, Sulodexide 💊).

## Discussion

The authors of the announcement emphasize that the use of these medications is still considered an "individual treatment attempt." This requires comprehensive patient education and consent. They urge caution regarding drug interactions and contraindications and strongly recommend the "start low, go slow" practice (starting with a very low dose and increasing slowly), which is well-established for ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The introduction of this medication list represents significant progress in the care of ME/CFS and PAIS patients in Austria. It creates an official framework for symptomatic treatment and improves access to therapies. Future work will include the systematic observation of treatment outcomes to further optimize care and create a basis for future clinical trials.

## Summary

This research provides powerful visual evidence for a biological cause of muscle-related symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID. The discovery of thickened and narrowed capillaries, along with fewer capillaries in ME/CFS, helps explain why patients experience severe fatigue and post-exertional malaise. These physical blockages at a microscopic level can restrict blood flow, limit oxygen and nutrient delivery, and prevent waste clearance in the muscles. This moves the understanding of the illness away from subjective symptoms towards a defined, structural pathology and opens up new avenues for developing diagnostics and treatments aimed at repairing or improving microvascular function.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the underlying physical causes of muscle fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) in ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. Researchers hypothesized that a "peripheral oxygenation deficit," caused by an inability to match oxygen delivery with the muscles' oxygen consumption, was a key factor. To test this, they examined the structure and function of the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) in the skeletal muscles of patients and healthy controls.

## Why was it researched?

Patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID suffer from debilitating muscle fatigue and PEM, but the biological reasons for these symptoms are not well understood. This research was prompted by the need to identify a concrete physiological mechanism that could explain why physical exertion leads to a severe worsening of symptoms. The study aimed to find physical evidence of microvascular defects that could impair oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle tissue.

## How was it researched?

This was a comparative laboratory study analyzing patient tissue and physiological responses to exercise. The researchers recruited three groups: ME/CFS patients, Long COVID patients, and healthy controls. They measured cardio-pulmonary function and muscle oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during and after an exercise test. Additionally, they took biopsies from the *vastus lateralis* (a large thigh muscle) to assess capillary density (capillarization), collagen IV deposits, and the ultrastructure of the capillaries using advanced microscopy.

## What has been found?

The study found significant structural abnormalities in the muscle capillaries of both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients compared to healthy controls. The capillary basement membrane, a layer surrounding the vessel, was significantly thicker, and there was increased deposition of collagen IV. This thickening resulted in a significantly smaller lumen radius, narrowing the channel through which blood flows. Furthermore, ME/CFS patients specifically showed significantly lower capillary density (fewer capillaries per muscle fiber). These structural issues correlated with reduced exercise capacity and were accompanied by signs of endothelial stress and damage to the cells lining the capillaries.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how the observed abnormalities—reduced lumen space, thickening of the basement membrane, and endothelial dysfunction—directly impair the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to muscle cells and hinder the removal of metabolic waste products. These microvascular defects create a physiological environment that predisposes patients to premature fatigue. The findings suggest that the problem is not just about blood flow volume but also about the diffusion capacity, which is compromised by the thickened vessel walls.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit significant and pathological structural changes in their muscle microvasculature. These abnormalities provide a direct physical explanation for the impaired oxygen supply and exercise intolerance characteristic of these illnesses. Future work will likely focus on validating these findings in larger patient cohorts and investigating the upstream mechanisms causing this capillary damage, which could lead to new diagnostic tools and targeted treatments.

## Summary

This review consolidates the idea that for a subset of ME/CFS and Post-COVID patients, the illness may be driven by an autoimmune process involving harmful antibodies. It explains that clinical trials for treatments targeting these antibodies have produced mixed results, likely because they were tested on broad patient groups rather than just those with clear signs of autoimmunity. The key message is that future research must focus on using biomarkers to identify the right patients for these specific therapies, a strategy that could finally lead to effective, personalized treatments for this subgroup of patients.

## What was researched?

This editorial reviews the current evidence for therapies that target autoantibodies (AAbs) as a potential treatment strategy for Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It summarizes the results of clinical trials for various immunomodulatory drugs and procedures.

## Why was it researched?

There is mounting evidence suggesting that autoimmunity, specifically the presence of harmful autoantibodies, plays a role in a subset of patients with PCS and ME/CFS. As there are no approved causal therapies for these conditions, exploring treatments that can remove or neutralize these autoantibodies is considered one of the most promising avenues for developing effective interventions.

## How was it researched?

This article is an expert opinion and literature review. The authors analyzed and summarized the findings from various clinical trials and observational studies investigating AAb-targeting therapies. The treatments reviewed include B-cell depleting agents like rituximab 💊, immunoadsorption 💊, intravenous immunoglobulins 💊 (IVIG), and newer drugs such as daratumumab 💊, efgartigimod, and rovunaptabin (BC007).

## What has been found?

The review found mixed results across different AAb-targeting therapies. While early-phase trials of rituximab and observational studies of immunoadsorption and IVIG showed promising results in some ME/CFS and PCS patients, subsequent larger or controlled trials have often been disappointing. For instance, a phase III trial of rituximab failed to show significant benefits, and recent phase II trials of efgartigimod and rovunaptabin in PCS also failed to meet their primary endpoints. Preliminary results for daratumumab are encouraging but very early.

## Discussion

The authors argue that a major reason for the inconsistent and often negative trial results is the failure to account for the heterogeneity of these illnesses. Most studies did not select patients based on evidence of autoimmunity, such as the presence of specific AAbs. This lack of patient stratification likely led to the inclusion of patients whose disease is not driven by autoantibodies, thereby diluting any potential treatment effect and contributing to trial failures.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that AAb-targeting therapy remains a promising strategy for a specific subgroup of PCS and ME/CFS patients. To move forward, future clinical trials must be designed with better patient selection criteria. They suggest using biomarkers, such as specific autoantibodies or a positive response to a preliminary treatment like immunoadsorption, to identify patients with a high likelihood of an AAb-mediated disease before enrolling them in trials for B-cell depleting therapies.

## Summary

This review of Long COVID treatments is highly relevant for the ME/CFS community, as it explores therapies for a condition with significant symptomatic overlap, including the potential for a formal ME/CFS diagnosis post-COVID. The paper systematically investigates interventions targeting key mechanisms also implicated in ME/CFS, such as immune dysfunction, neuroinflammation, microclots, and mitochondrial issues. The mention of familiar approaches like pacing and low-dose naltrexone (LDN), alongside emerging drugs like BC007 which targets autoantibodies, reinforces shared biological pathways and highlights how the massive research effort into Long COVID may accelerate therapeutic discovery for ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This article reviews and summarizes the existing evidence for a wide range of potential therapeutic strategies for Long COVID, covering both non-pharmaceutical interventions and various pharmacological treatments. The authors categorize these approaches based on the current understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of the condition, such as viral persistence, chronic inflammation, and microclots.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID affects at least 65 million people worldwide with a wide array of debilitating symptoms, including ME/CFS, yet there are no officially approved treatments. This review was conducted to consolidate the emerging research on potential therapies and link them to the proposed biological causes of the condition. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview to guide future research and clinical strategies.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review, referred to as a "Comment" article. The authors analyzed and summarized findings from a wide range of existing research papers, including randomized controlled trials, case series, and pilot studies. They systematically organized the collected evidence into non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions to provide a broad overview of the current therapeutic landscape for Long COVID.

## What has been found?

The review found that a diverse range of treatments show potential for Long COVID. Non-pharmaceutical approaches like pacing and breathing exercises are beneficial, though caution with unmoderated exercise is advised. In pharmaceuticals, antivirals such as ensitrelvir 💊 and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 💊 taken during acute infection may lower Long COVID risk. Symptom-specific drugs like low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 💊, anti-inflammatory agents like metformin 💊, and nutraceuticals including symbiotic preparations 💊 have demonstrated benefits for symptoms like fatigue and neuroinflammation. Other emerging interventions like hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) 💊 and the aptamer drug BC007 💊 have also shown positive results in early studies.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that while many potential treatments are emerging, the overall evidence is still limited and lacks high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials. They identify the uncertainty about the root cause of Long COVID as the primary barrier to developing effective, targeted treatments. Consequently, current strategies often require a multidisciplinary and multi-drug approach to manage the complex, multi-systemic symptoms.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that while evidence for Long COVID treatments is in its early stages, a variety of promising interventions are being investigated. They suggest that future progress depends on a deeper understanding of the disease's underlying mechanisms. This will enable the development of specific biomarkers and targeted drugs to guide more precise diagnosis and treatment in the future.

## Summary

This research identifies a specific neuro-immune bridge—the MRGPRX2 receptor—that translates immune activity into chronic pain in fibromyalgia. By pinpointing mast cells as the critical link between circulating antibodies and sensory hypersensitivity, the study shifts the view of fibromyalgia toward a peripheral autoimmune disorder. This discovery opens the door for developing targeted drugs that could block this pain pathway at its source.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether mast cells and the MRGPRX2 receptor mediate the pain-sensitizing effects of patient-derived immunoglobulin G (IgG) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).

## Why was it researched?

While previous research demonstrated that FMS symptoms could be transferred to mice using patient IgG, the specific cellular and molecular targets through which these antibodies cause pain remained unknown.

## How was it researched?

Researchers utilized a passive transfer model, injecting human FMS-IgG into mice with and without mast cells or the Mrgprb2 receptor (the rodent version of MRGPRX2). They also analyzed human skin biopsies for mast cell density and tested the activation of human mast cell lines by patient-derived antibodies.

## What has been found?

FMS-IgG binds directly to and activates mast cells via the MRGPRX2 receptor, triggering the release of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6. Mice lacking this receptor were entirely protected from the mechanical and cold pain hypersensitivity induced by patient antibodies, and human FMS skin samples showed significantly higher mast cell density compared to controls.

## Discussion

The study demonstrates that mast cells are essential for the development of pain in the FMS-IgG model, though they do not appear to mediate other symptoms like bowel dysfunction. As a preprint, these findings await final validation through the peer-review process.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that MRGPRX2 on mast cells is a critical mediator of autoantibody-induced pain in fibromyalgia. This finding suggests that inhibiting mast cells or the MRGPRX2 receptor represents a promising new therapeutic strategy for the condition.

## Summary

This research provides a direct biological mechanism for why LDN may be effective for long COVID. It suggests that LDN works by fixing a fundamental problem in the "calcium gates" (TRPM3 channels) of immune cells, which are known to be faulty in long COVID and ME/CFS. By restoring normal calcium flow, LDN may help normalize immune function and other cellular processes. This finding is significant because it validates a specific biological target for LDN, strengthening the scientific rationale for its use in treating this condition.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 💊 could correct a specific cellular dysfunction—faulty TRPM3 ion channels—in the natural killer (NK) cells of patients with long COVID.

## Why was it researched?

Dysfunctional TRPM3 ion channels are linked to long COVID, causing reduced calcium influx, which harms cellular processes. Since accumulating evidence suggests LDN might help long COVID patients, researchers wanted to see if its benefit was linked to fixing this specific ion channel problem.

## How was it researched?

This was a laboratory study comparing 27 participants. Researchers isolated NK cells from nine healthy controls, nine individuals with long COVID, and nine individuals with long COVID who were being treated with LDN (3–4.5 mg/day). They then used electrophysiological experiments to measure and compare the TRPM3 ion channel function among the three groups.

## What has been found?

The study found that long COVID patients treated with LDN have restored TRPM3 ion channel function. There was no significant difference in TRPM3 currents between the LDN-treated long COVID patients and the healthy controls. This result also validates previous reports that untreated long COVID patients do have significant TRPM3 dysfunction.

## Discussion

The authors' discussion states that these findings support LDN as a potentially beneficial treatment for long COVID. They conclude that the mechanism involves restoring TRPM3 ion channel function, which in turn reestablishes the adequate calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) influx necessary for normal cellular processes.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The primary conclusion is that LDN treatment appears to reverse a key pathological feature (TRPM3 dysfunction) in the NK cells of long COVID patients, making their cells indistinguishable from healthy controls in this assay. (The provided text does not outline specific future work.)

## Summary

This study highlights that the brain fog, cognitive issues, and physical symptoms experienced by ME/CFS and Long COVID patients are likely driven by measurable biological changes, particularly high levels of cellular oxidative stress and an overactive immune system. By linking these conditions to the long-term effects of pandemics, the research advocates for treating ME/CFS as a serious neurological disorder rather than just a state of fatigue. This shift in perspective is crucial for moving toward future diagnostics and treatments that focus on protecting the brain from the chronic inflammation seen after viral infections.

## What was researched?

This research highlight explored the shared biological mechanisms between long-haul COVID-19 and ME/CFS, specifically focusing on how both conditions involve multisystem metabolic, immune, and inflammatory dysregulation. The author examined the role of oxidative stress in the central nervous system and proposed that ME/CFS serves as a critical model for understanding how the brain is reshaped following a pandemic.

## Why was it researched?

Despite millions of people suffering from fatiguing syndromes, these conditions have historically been underserved and neglected in both clinical practice and basic research. The massive surge in Long COVID cases—approximately half of which meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS—has created an urgent need to bridge the gap between neurobiology and the understanding of neurodegenerative processes in these illnesses.

## How was it researched?

This was a literature-based review and conceptual analysis that synthesized findings from recent neurobiological studies, historical pandemic data, and clinical observations. The author analyzed the overlap in symptoms and pathophysiology between Long COVID and ME/CFS, specifically looking at cellular oxidative stress, the failure of immune "brakes," and historical evidence of autoimmune propensity following major viral outbreaks.

## What has been found?

The paper identifies oxidative stress as a central feature of ME/CFS and Long COVID, suggesting that it contributes to long-term central nervous system malfunction. It highlights that viral infections can act as "provocateurs" that permanently alter immune system activity, potentially leading to the production of autoantibodies against neurotransmitters and steroid hormones. Furthermore, the study notes that the multisystem presentation of Long COVID is strikingly similar to ME/CFS, indicating that both conditions may involve chronic neuroinflammation and potential neurodegenerative aspects if left unaddressed.

## Discussion

The author argues that current Long COVID research often fails to build upon decades of existing ME/CFS knowledge, which can lead to misguided conclusions. There is a critique of the medical community's reluctance to classify ME/CFS as a neurodegenerative or neurological condition despite evidence of declining neurological health and debilitating symptoms in patients.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The author concludes that ME/CFS and Long COVID represent a unified paradigm for studying the impact of sustained oxidative stress on the human brain and body. Future research must prioritize finding neuroprotective strategies and better diagnostic markers to prevent the long-term cognitive and neurological decline associated with these post-viral syndromes.

## What was researched?

The study evaluates the effectiveness of daratumumab 💊 in reducing the symptoms and improving the physical function of patients diagnosed with moderate to severe ME/CFS compared to those receiving a placebo.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating condition with no standard approved treatment, and researchers aim to evaluate if daratumumab 💊 can help alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for those with moderate to severe forms of the disease. The drug as shown very promising results in a pilot study. Paper: [Fluge et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2025.1607353)

## How was it researched?

This clinical trial involves participants aged 18 to 64 who have had ME/CFS for at least two years and meet specific diagnostic criteria, including a minimum NK-cell level of 125 x10⁹/L. Participants are randomized to receive either daratumumab 💊 (combined with hyaluronidase) or a placebo via subcutaneous injection. The study includes a 26-week treatment phase and follow-up assessments through week 60, monitoring progress via symptom severity scores (DSQ-SF), physical function, and daily activity levels.

## What has been found?

As a follow-up study that is currently ongoing, final results regarding the efficacy and overall response to treatment are not yet available. The study is designed to assess changes in symptoms and physical function compared to the baseline measurements taken at the start of the trial.

## Discussion

The study is designed with strict eligibility criteria, excluding patients with psychiatric disorders, other serious medical conditions, or a history of cancer to ensure the clarity of the results. Safety and potential side effects are being continuously monitored throughout the trial period to ensure participant welfare.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The final results of this study will contribute to the broader understanding of daratumumab’s 💊 role in treating ME/CFS and may provide a foundation for future therapeutic interventions for the condition.

## Summary

This research identifies a specific molecular abnormality in the immune cells of ME/CFS patients that directly correlates with disease severity. It suggests that a key regulatory protein (SMPDL3B) is being improperly cut from the surface of immune cells, leading to increased inflammation. This provides a potential biological explanation for some of the immune dysregulation in the illness and offers a quantifiable biomarker. Most significantly, the study showed in a lab setting that two existing drugs can reverse this process, presenting a clear and targeted new avenue for the development of future treatments that must now be tested in human trials.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the role of a specific immune-regulatory protein, Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B), in ME/CFS. Researchers aimed to determine if levels of this protein could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and if modulating it could represent a new therapeutic strategy.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating illness with no objective diagnostic tests or targeted treatments, partly due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying biology. Since immune dysfunction is a known hallmark of the disease, the researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of SMPDL3B, a protein involved in regulating innate immune responses, might contribute to the chronic inflammation and impaired antiviral defenses seen in patients.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study that analyzed blood samples from two separate groups: a Canadian cohort of 249 ME patients and 63 healthy controls, and a Norwegian replication cohort of 141 ME patients. The researchers used ELISA and flow cytometry to measure the levels of SMPDL3B in the plasma (soluble form) and on the surface of immune cells (membrane-bound form). They also performed *in vitro* experiments on immune cells (PBMCs) to see if existing drugs could correct any abnormalities found.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients had significantly elevated levels of soluble SMPDL3B in their plasma, and these higher levels correlated with greater symptom severity. In contrast, the amount of SMPDL3B attached to the surface of their immune cells (monocytes) was significantly reduced. This appears to be caused by increased activity of an enzyme called PI-PLC, which cleaves SMPDL3B from the cell membrane. In laboratory experiments, two existing drugs, vildagliptin 💊 and saxagliptin 💊, successfully restored the membrane-bound SMPDL3B and reduced the soluble form by inhibiting PI-PLC activity.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the loss of membrane-bound SMPDL3B, which normally helps to dampen inflammatory signaling (via TLR4), could contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in ME/CFS. This imbalance could also explain previously observed abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The primary limitations noted were the cross-sectional study design, which cannot prove causation, and a significant female predominance in the patient cohorts, which limited robust analysis of sex-specific differences.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that SMPDL3B is a promising biomarker for ME/CFS severity and a potential therapeutic target. The *in vitro* success of vildagliptin and saxagliptin in preserving membrane-bound SMPDL3B suggests a novel treatment strategy for restoring immune balance. The study calls for future clinical trials to evaluate the potential of these drugs to mitigate immune dysfunction and reduce symptoms in ME/CFS patients.

## Summary

This large-scale survey reinforces the significant symptomatic and therapeutic overlap between ME/CFS and long COVID, suggesting they may share underlying disease mechanisms. By analyzing patient experiences, the research identified several widely-used treatments—such as pacing, electrolytes, and LDN—that are perceived as highly beneficial, while confirming that graded exercise therapy is seen as harmful. The identification of distinct patient subgroups who respond differently to specific medications supports a move towards personalized medicine and provides a data-driven basis for designing more targeted and effective clinical trials for these complex illnesses.

## What was researched?

This study analyzed patient-reported outcomes from a large survey of 3,925 individuals to assess the perceived effectiveness of more than 150 different treatments for ME/CFS and long COVID. The research also explored the relationships between patient demographics, symptom profiles, comorbidities, and their responses to these interventions.

## Why was it researched?

With no FDA-approved treatments for either ME/CFS or long COVID, patients rely on off-label and palliative therapies. This study was conducted to gather real-world evidence from patient experiences, aiming to identify potentially effective management strategies, highlight symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between the two conditions, and help generate new avenues for future clinical trials.

## How was it researched?

This was a patient-reported outcomes study based on data from the online "TREATME" survey. The researchers collected responses from 3,925 patients (2,125 with ME/CFS and 1,800 with long COVID) regarding their symptoms, comorbidities, and perceived effectiveness of various treatments. A "Net Assessment Score" (NAS) was calculated to quantify the benefit of each intervention, and clustering analysis was used to identify patient subgroups based on their unique symptom profiles.

## What has been found?

The study revealed a strong correlation ($R^{2}=0.68$) in treatment responses between ME/CFS and long COVID patients, who also shared similar core symptoms like PEM and fatigue. The interventions with the greatest perceived benefits included pacing, fluids/electrolytes 💊, compression stockings, low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 💊, antihistamines 💊, nattokinase/lumbrokinase 💊, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IgG) 💊. Four distinct patient subgroups with unique symptom profiles (e.g., "POTS-Dominant") were identified, showing varied responses to specific treatments, such as ADHD stimulants 💊 being most effective in the "Cognitive and Sleep Dysfunction" cluster. Graded exercise therapy (GET) was overwhelmingly reported as harmful.

## Discussion

The authors note that the study's findings support the use of large-scale patient surveys for gathering real-world evidence. They acknowledge several limitations, including the self-reported nature of the data, potential for sampling and recall bias, the absence of a true placebo control group, and the difficulty of attributing effects when patients use multiple treatments simultaneously. The reliability for some treatments is also limited by a small number of responses.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that patient-reported data from large surveys provide a valuable foundation of real-world evidence for therapies and can help inform the design of future clinical trials for ME/CFS and long COVID. They suggest future studies could be enhanced by integrating data from health-tracking apps and electronic health records, and by using more targeted surveys to confirm these preliminary findings.

## Summary

This study provides strong preliminary evidence for the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease driven by autoantibodies. By using a drug that targets the specific immune cells responsible for long-term antibody production, researchers observed significant, life-altering improvements in a majority of the trial participants. The finding that a higher baseline count of Natural Killer (NK) cells was associated with a better outcome could potentially lead to a biomarker to predict who would benefit from this type of treatment. While these results from a small, open-label trial are very encouraging, they must be confirmed in the larger, placebo-controlled trial that is now underway before any definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy can be made.

## What was researched?

This clinical pilot study investigated the safety and feasibility of using the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab 💊 to target and deplete plasma cells in patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. The researchers also assessed whether this treatment could lead to clinical improvement over a 12 to 24-month follow-up period.

## Why was it researched?

The study was based on the hypothesis that ME/CFS is an autoimmune condition driven by functional autoantibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells. Previous trials using the B-cell depleting drug rituximab failed to show a difference from placebo, which the researchers speculate is because rituximab does not affect these long-lived plasma cells. This study aimed to test if directly targeting these antibody-producing cells with daratumumab could be a more effective strategy.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective, open-label pilot trial involving ten female patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS. After a 12-week observation period, all patients received injections of daratumumab; six patients received four injections and four patients received a total of seven injections. Clinical outcomes were measured using self-reported questionnaires (SF-36 Physical Function and DSQ-SF), physical activity trackers (Fitbit), and laboratory tests, including immunoglobulin (IgG) and Natural Killer (NK) cell counts.

## What has been found?

The treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Six out of the ten patients experienced marked and sustained clinical improvement, with five of them reaching a physical function score close to or within the normal population range by the end of the follow-up. For the six responders, the average physical function score (SF-36 PF) increased from 32.2 to 78.3. The study also found a significant correlation between a higher baseline NK-cell count and a positive clinical response.

## Discussion

The authors note that the main limitations of the study are the small number of participants (10), the inclusion of only female patients, and the open-label design, which lacks a placebo control group. They suggest the observed association between higher baseline NK-cell counts and clinical improvement may be biologically significant, as NK cells are involved in the drug's mechanism of depleting plasma cells. The dichotomous response pattern—either pronounced improvement or no change at all—was a notable observation.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that targeting plasma cells with daratumumab was feasible, safe, and associated with major and durable symptom improvement in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that functional autoantibodies from long-lived plasma cells play a key role in the disease. A larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was launched in June 2025 to confirm these promising results.

## Summary

This study provides statistical evidence that the "brain fog" experienced by patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID is not a single entity, but is composed of at least two distinct types of problems: traditional cognitive difficulties (memory, focus) and sensory overload (hypersensitivity to light, noise, smells). By formally identifying sensory issues as a separate but core component of neurocognitive impairment, this research validates a key aspect of the patient experience. This framework could improve diagnostic criteria, allow for more precise symptom tracking in clinical trials, and guide researchers to investigate specific brain networks, like the Salience Network, as potential targets for future treatments.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the structure of self-reported neurocognitive symptoms in large groups of patients with ME/CFS and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Researchers aimed to determine if symptoms like sensory hypersensitivity, which are often overlooked, group together with more classic "brain fog" symptoms like memory and concentration problems, or if they form a separate category.

## Why was it researched?

While memory and concentration problems are well-recognized neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS and PASC, sensory issues like hypersensitivity to light and noise have been less formally studied as part of this symptom cluster. Some diagnostic criteria, like the Canadian Consensus Criteria, include these sensory disturbances. This research was prompted by the need to statistically evaluate whether these sensory symptoms constitute a distinct domain of neurocognitive impairment in these post-viral illnesses.

## How was it researched?

This was a patient data analysis study using self-report surveys. The researchers aggregated data from 2,313 patients with ME/CFS and 299 patients with PASC who had completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ-1). They then used a statistical method called exploratory factor analysis on 13 neurocognitive symptom items from the questionnaire to identify underlying patterns and group related symptoms into distinct "factors" for each illness group.

## What has been found?

The analysis revealed a similar two-factor structure for both the ME/CFS and PASC groups. The first factor consisted of classic cognitive symptoms such as problems with memory, slowness of thought, and difficulty paying attention. The second, distinct factor consisted of sensory and perceptual disturbances, including sensitivity to light, noise, and smells. The study also found that patients who reported more severe functional impairment scored significantly worse on both of these neurocognitive factors.

## Discussion

The authors note several limitations, including the reliance on self-reported diagnoses and symptoms rather than clinical confirmation, and the unequal sample sizes between the ME/CFS and PASC groups. They suggest the two identified factors may correspond to dysfunction in different brain networks, with the memory/concentration factor relating to the Central Executive Network and the sensory factor relating to overactivation of the Salience Network. The influence of comorbid conditions on these networks was acknowledged as a complex area for future study.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS and PASC can be classified into two distinct domains: one related to memory and concentration, and another related to sensory overload. These findings suggest that research and clinical assessment should expand beyond traditional cognitive complaints to include sensory disturbances as a core feature. Future research should aim to connect these self-reported symptom domains with objective biological measures and further explore the underlying brain network abnormalities.

## Summary

This Phase 3 clinical trial investigates whether low-dose sirolimus (rapamycin) 💊, a well-known immune-modulating drug, can effectively treat the underlying biological drivers of Long COVID. By targeting the mTOR pathway, researchers aim to address cellular dysfunction and immune exhaustion that may cause persistent fatigue and cognitive issues. If the trial is successful, it could provide one of the first evidence-based pharmacological treatments for Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19.

## What was researched?

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of low-dose sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) for adults suffering from Long COVID. The research specifically focuses on whether the intervention improves patient-reported health outcomes and symptom severity.

## Why was it researched?

The trial was initiated based on evidence that Long COVID may be driven by mTOR pathway overactivation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and viral persistence. Researchers believe that inhibiting this pathway could potentially reset the immune system and improve energy production at a cellular level.

## How was it researched?

This is an IND-exempt, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving approximately 80 participants. The study utilizes a multi-ascending dose escalation scheme over a 12-week treatment period to identify the most effective and tolerable dosage for patients.

## What has been found?

As the trial is currently in the recruitment phase, definitive efficacy results have not yet been published. Preliminary observations from other cohorts indicated that patients taking sirolimus for unrelated reasons appeared to have a lower incidence of developing Long COVID after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Discussion

A key strength of this study is its focus on Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) and moderate-to-severe fatigue as inclusion criteria. However, the exclusion of individuals with pre-2020 ME/CFS diagnoses limits the immediate generalizability to the broader chronic fatigue community.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The trial represents a significant effort to repurpose existing medications to treat complex post-viral conditions. Future results will determine if mTOR inhibition is a viable therapeutic target for PASC and similar chronic illnesses.

## Summary

This study investigated oxaloacetate, a supplement involved in cellular energy production, as a potential treatment for long COVID. While it failed to significantly improve fatigue according to the main questionnaire, it showed promising results on other fronts. Participants taking oxaloacetate experienced a more rapid reduction in their overall symptom burden and, importantly, showed significant improvements on objective tests of cognitive function, or "brain fog." These cognitive improvements were linked to their symptom improvements, suggesting a real biological effect. Although preliminary, this research highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for addressing the debilitating cognitive deficits in long COVID, warranting further investigation in larger studies.

## What was researched?

This randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial evaluated whether a daily oral dose of oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 could effectively and safely improve fatigue and cognitive function in adults diagnosed with long COVID. The study's primary goal was to measure the reduction in fatigue over a 42-day period.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a persistent and often disabling condition with no widely accepted treatments available. Emerging research suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and altered metabolism may contribute to its symptoms. As oxaloacetate is a key intermediate in cellular energy production and has shown promise in previous trials for reducing fatigue in ME/CFS and long COVID, this study aimed to rigorously test its efficacy.

## How was it researched?

This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial involving 69 adults with long COVID. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2,000 mg/day of oxaloacetate or a placebo (rice flour) for 42 days. The primary outcome was fatigue, measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), while secondary outcomes included symptom burden (DSQ-SF), quality of life (RAND-36), objective cognitive function (DANA Brain Vital), and physical activity (UP Time).

## What has been found?

The study did not find a statistically significant difference in fatigue reduction between the oxaloacetate and placebo groups based on the primary measure (CFQ). However, the group taking OAA showed significantly greater improvements in both fatigue and total symptom burden at day 21 when measured by a different questionnaire (DSQ-SF). Furthermore, the OAA group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in objective measures of cognitive function, and these cognitive gains were strongly correlated with symptom reduction. The treatment was well tolerated.

## Discussion

The authors note that the primary outcome measure, the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), may have lacked the sensitivity to detect treatment effects in the complex long COVID population. They suggest that other multi-domain questionnaires, like the DSQ-SF, might be more appropriate for capturing clinically meaningful changes. Key limitations of the study include its modest sample size, the short 42-day duration which may not have been long enough to observe changes in physical function, and its single-site design.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that although the primary endpoint for fatigue was not met, the positive results from secondary measures provide evidence that oxaloacetate may offer clinically meaningful benefits for improving overall symptom burden and cognitive function in individuals with long COVID. The findings support the need for larger, longer-duration trials using a range of sensitive outcome measures to confirm the efficacy of OAA and to better understand its mechanisms of action.

## Summary

This study introduces a powerful AI tool that integrates vast amounts of biological data from the gut, blood, and immune system to create a more comprehensive and personalized picture of ME/CFS. By connecting specific biological abnormalities to individual symptoms, it moves beyond a simple "sick vs. healthy" comparison and begins to explain the disease's profound variability. The findings reinforce that ME/CFS involves a significant breakdown in the communication between the gut microbiome and the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation that correlates with symptom severity. This approach provides a new framework for discovering more precise biomarkers and generating targeted hypotheses for future treatment research.

## What was researched?

This study developed and applied a deep neural network, named BioMapAI, to a large longitudinal, multi-omics dataset from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. The objective was to integrate diverse biological data—including gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, and immune profiling—to predict clinical symptom severity, identify specific biomarkers, and create a comprehensive map of the biological interactions underlying the disease.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a complex illness with highly variable symptoms, which makes diagnosis and treatment challenging. Previous studies often focused on identifying one or two key disease indicators, an approach that fails to capture the multifaceted nature of the condition. This research was motivated by the need for methods that can link a wide range of biological data types to the complex matrix of patient-specific symptoms, enabling a more personalized understanding of the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a 4-year longitudinal study that collected data from a cohort of 153 ME/CFS patients and 96 healthy controls. The researchers gathered multiple data types: gut microbiome sequencing, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiling, standard blood lab results, and detailed clinical questionnaires. They used this extensive dataset to train BioMapAI, an explainable AI model, to map the biological profiles to 12 core clinical symptom scores. The model's ability to classify ME/CFS was validated using both held-out data from the cohort and four independent, external patient datasets.

## What has been found?

The BioMapAI model successfully classified ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (91% AUC). The study identified both disease-specific biomarkers (consistent across most symptoms) and, more uniquely, symptom-specific biomarkers. Key findings include altered associations in ME/CFS between gut microbial metabolism (e.g., of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, BCAAs, and tryptophan) and a heightened inflammatory response from specific T cell subsets (MAIT and $\gamma\delta$T cells). These disruptions in the microbe-immune network were strongly correlated with the severity of symptoms like fatigue, pain, gastrointestinal issues, and sleep disturbances.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including that the model was not tested for its ability to differentiate ME/CFS from other conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as fibromyalgia. The study cohort was from a single geographic location and predominantly white, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the 4-year study period may not be sufficient to capture the full, often decades-long, nonlinear progression of ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that their AI-driven, multi-omics approach provides unprecedented systems-level insights into ME/CFS, refining existing hypotheses and generating new ones about the disrupted connections between the microbiome, metabolome, and immune system. While the findings are not yet ready for direct therapeutic application, they offer numerous avenues for future mechanistic studies. The researchers suggest future work should include longer follow-up periods and incorporate other data types, like host RNA sequencing, to further unravel the disease's complexity.

## Summary

This review provides a comprehensive history of the diagnostic tools developed for Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), an illness triggered by environmental biotoxins from sources like water-damaged buildings. It strongly contrasts the precise, evidence-based diagnostic pathway for CIRS with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding ME/CFS, despite their similar symptom presentations. The paper makes a compelling case that many individuals diagnosed with ME/CFS may instead have treatable CIRS, which can be identified through a specific panel of blood tests, vision screening, brain imaging, and advanced gene expression analysis. By demonstrating that CIRS biomarkers normalize with targeted therapies, this work offers a potential path to an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment for a subset of patients struggling with chronic, unexplained illness.

## What was researched?

This review paper provides a chronological history of the development of biomarkers used to diagnose Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). It traces the evolution from early functional tests, like visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), to advanced genomic profiling, aiming to establish a clear diagnostic framework that can differentiate CIRS from ME/CFS.

## Why was it researched?

CIRS and ME/CFS share debilitating and overlapping symptoms, often leading to misdiagnosis. However, ME/CFS lacks validated biomarkers and a reproducible diagnostic model, whereas CIRS is defined by a consistent pattern of immune dysregulation linked to environmental biotoxin exposure. The author suggests that many patients diagnosed with ME/CFS may actually have unrecognized and treatable CIRS, necessitating a clearer method for differential diagnosis.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review that synthesizes peer-reviewed studies, clinical trials, and case reports spanning more than two decades. The author chronologically organizes the integration of CIRS biomarkers, starting with early functional and screening tests and progressing through neuroendocrine, immunologic, volumetric brain imaging, and ultimately transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression: Inflammation Explained (GENIE) platform.

## What has been found?

The review demonstrates that CIRS has a structured, reproducible diagnostic model supported by a specific constellation of biomarkers, including low MSH, elevated MMP-9 and TGF-β1, and distinct brain volume changes on NeuroQuant MRI. The development of the GENIE transcriptomic test has further refined diagnosis by identifying a core pattern of "molecular hypometabolism" and even suggesting specific environmental triggers like Actinobacteria. The paper highlights that protocol-based treatments, such as cholestyramine (CSM) 💊 and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) 💊, have been shown to normalize these objective markers and resolve symptoms.

## Discussion

The author emphasizes the key distinction between the two illnesses: CIRS has a structured case definition, a reproducible biomarker panel, and measurable responses to targeted therapy. In contrast, ME/CFS is described as a heterogeneous condition with inconsistent case definitions, elusive biomarkers, and primarily symptomatic treatments that do not reverse the underlying pathophysiology. This diagnostic precision in CIRS offers a potential explanation for a subset of patients currently classified under the broader ME/CFS umbrella.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The author concludes that the CIRS framework represents a validated model of an environmentally acquired illness that is responsive to treatment and aligned with precision medicine. Future research should focus on evaluating ME/CFS patients for CIRS to see if they might benefit from its established diagnostic and treatment protocols. The paper suggests the structured, biomarker-guided approach used for CIRS could serve as a model for unraveling other complex, multi-system chronic illnesses.

## Summary

This research explores a non-drug, self-regulation technique called HRV-Biofeedback as a potential management tool for ME/CFS symptoms that arise after a COVID-19 infection. The study's most important finding is a significant reduction in severe fatigue, a core symptom of the illness, which is noteworthy given the lack of proven treatments. Critically, the intervention proved to be very practical and acceptable to patients, with almost no one dropping out, in stark contrast to more controversial interventions previously studied. While this is an early-stage study that does not provide a definitive treatment, it offers strong justification for larger trials and presents a potential new direction for a safe, empowering symptom management tool.

## What was researched?

This Phase II controlled trial investigated if Heart Rate Variability-Biofeedback (HRV-BF), a non-pharmacological intervention, is a feasible and potentially effective therapy for individuals with Long COVID who meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The study's primary goals were to assess feasibility through dropout rates and patient satisfaction, and to measure preliminary changes in symptoms like fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain.

## Why was it researched?

The symptoms of Long COVID frequently overlap with those of ME/CFS, a condition for which there are no proven effective treatments. This has created an urgent need for new, safe, and integrative management strategies. Researchers hypothesized that HRV-BF, a technique aimed at improving self-regulation of the nervous system, could be a practical and acceptable intervention to help manage the complex symptom burden in this patient population.

## How was it researched?

This was a small, controlled feasibility study involving 18 participants with Long COVID and ME/CFS. The participants were assigned to one of two groups: an intervention group that received 10 sessions of HRV-BF over five weeks in addition to their usual medical care, or a control group that only received usual care. The HRV-BF sessions involved using real-time feedback on heart rate to learn controlled breathing patterns. Researchers used standardized questionnaires to measure fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life before and after the intervention period.

## What has been found?

The study demonstrated that HRV-BF is a highly feasible and well-tolerated intervention, with a very low dropout rate (5.56%) and high participant satisfaction. The main finding was a statistically significant improvement in severe fatigue in the HRV-BF group compared to the control group. While improvements in other individual symptoms like anxiety, depression, and pain were not statistically significant, an overall trend of positive changes was observed across all measures in the group that received the intervention.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that as a small, preliminary Phase II study, the findings are not definitive proof of clinical efficacy and should be interpreted with caution. The study's main limitation is its small sample size, which increases the possibility of the results being due to chance. However, a key strength highlighted is the excellent feasibility of the intervention, demonstrated by an exceptionally low dropout rate compared to other non-pharmacological therapies studied in ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that HRV-BF is a feasible, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for people with ME/CFS following Long COVID. The promising preliminary results, particularly for reducing fatigue, strongly support the need for larger, more definitive Phase III clinical trials. Future research should aim to confirm these benefits and investigate the intervention's potential effects on the broader spectrum of ME/CFS and Long COVID symptoms.

## Summary

This real-world study provides a mixed and cautious outlook on hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) 💊 for long COVID. It found that while a majority of patients (56-63%) experienced significant improvements in quality of life and cognitive symptoms three months after treatment, a notable minority (13-19%) got significantly worse. This is a crucial finding, as it highlights a potential risk of deterioration, possibly because the intensive treatment is too exhausting for those with post-exertional malaise. Because the study did not have a placebo group and included only patients who could pay for the treatment themselves, the authors cannot be certain the benefits were caused by the HBOT 💊. The results underscore that HBOT 💊 is not a guaranteed cure and may carry serious risks for some patients.

## What was researched?

This study used a prospective registry to gather real-world data on the patient characteristics and outcomes of long COVID patients who underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) 💊. This paper specifically reports the results from the 3-month follow-up period.

## Why was it researched?

HBOT 💊 has shown potential benefits for long COVID, leading to high patient demand. However, many clinical questions remain, and the treatment lacks formal guideline recommendations or reimbursement. This registry was created to gain more insight into its real-world effects, especially in long-term ill patients.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective registry study involving 232 long COVID patients from six hyperbaric centers in the Netherlands. Patients had been ill for a median of 20 months before starting treatment. Researchers collected patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) at baseline, after treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were the mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component scores of the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. A clinically relevant change was defined as a 10-point or more increase (responder) or decrease (negative-responder) at 3 months.

## What has been found?

At the 3-month follow-up, 56-63% of patients were classified as "responders," showing a clinically relevant improvement in their quality of life scores (MCS/PCS). However, 13-19% of patients were "negative-responders," experiencing a clinically relevant *deterioration* in their scores. The symptoms that showed the most improvement were predominantly in the cognitive domain, such as brain fog, memory problems, and word-finding problems. Work status was largely unchanged, with only a small fraction of patients (11%) who were unable to work returning to work.

## Discussion

The authors state the primary limitation is the observational nature of the study and the lack of a control group, meaning a causal effect of HBOT 💊 cannot be established. They note a likely selection bias, as patients had to be able to finance the off-label treatment themselves. The finding that 13-19% of patients worsened is highlighted as an important safety signal, suggesting the intensive HBOT 💊 treatment may be too exhausting for certain patients, particularly those with post-exertional malaise.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that while the majority of patients reported a significant increase in quality of life, a minority reported a significant deterioration. They state that clinicians must be alert to this risk of worsening. This registry data will serve as a foundation for future prospective, controlled trials to confirm the results and investigate dose-response, with one such trial already planned in the Netherlands.

## Summary

This case report provides a detailed account of a remarkable recovery in a patient with severe Long COVID, ME/CFS, and POTS using a combined ketogenic diet and lifestyle intervention. The authors suggest that this approach may work by correcting underlying metabolic issues, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance, which are increasingly thought to be drivers of the illness. For patients familiar with the typical non-recovering trajectory of ME/CFS, this report is significant because it documents a return to a high level of function from a state of severe disability. While this is only a single case, it offers a strong, biologically-plausible rationale for larger clinical trials to investigate metabolic therapies as a potential treatment.

## What was researched?

This paper presents a case report on a 44-year-old female with severe Long COVID, including diagnoses of ME/CFS and POTS. It documents her response to a 12-week, remotely-delivered program that combined a ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) with lifestyle interventions aimed at stabilizing circadian rhythms and incorporating mindfulness.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a widespread and complex chronic condition with no FDA-approved treatments. The authors propose that because it affects multiple body systems, a multi-component, "whole person" approach is likely required. This study was conducted to explore whether targeting proposed underlying mechanisms of Long COVID, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, with a combined metabolic and lifestyle intervention could reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.

## How was it researched?

This study is a clinical case report of one patient. Prior to the main intervention, the patient had tried numerous treatments; some provided limited relief, including low dose naltrexone 💊 which decreased neuropathic pain, iron infusions 💊 which resolved iron deficiency, and saline infusions 💊 which temporarily reduced hypotension. In February 2024, she enrolled in a 12-week virtual program that included a specialized ketogenic diet, daily supplements including Benfotiamine 💊 (a form of Vitamin B1), Magnesium 💊, and Potassium 💊, and health coaching on lifestyle changes like sleep routines and mindfulness. Her symptoms and functional capacity were tracked using standardized patient-reported outcome questionnaires before the intervention and at one, four, and seven months after it began.

## What has been found?

The patient experienced significant and clinically meaningful improvements across multiple domains. Within the first two weeks of the intervention, her chronic hypotension resolved, and she discontinued IV saline therapy. Over the course of the program and the following months, she reported resolution of light and sound sensitivity, normalization of her menstrual cycle, a drastic reduction in headaches, and improvement in brain fog. Most notably, her extreme fatigue episodes and post-exertional malaise (PEM) diminished, allowing her to resume daily activities, return to work full-time, and engage in light exercise without crashing.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge the primary limitation of a case report is that it cannot prove cause and effect; the patient's improvement could be due to a placebo effect or natural disease progression. It is also impossible to determine which component of the multimodal intervention was most impactful. However, they contrast the patient's dramatic recovery with recent studies showing that most Long COVID patients' symptoms remain largely unchanged in the second year of illness, highlighting the potential significance of these findings.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the synergistic effects of combining ketogenic metabolic therapy with lifestyle interventions may target multiple underlying mechanisms of Long COVID, leading to reduced symptom burden and improved quality of life. They state that these clinical observations support the need for future, larger research trials to formally evaluate and optimize such multimodal nutritional and lifestyle programs for patients with Long COVID and related conditions.

## Summary

This research provides a potential biological mechanism that connects impaired cellular "housekeeping" (autophagy) to the mitochondrial dysfunction, immune activation, and post-exertional malaise seen in ME/CFS. By using a mouse model, the study demonstrates how a single genetic defect can cause immune cells to become inflammatory, leading them to infiltrate muscles, damage local nerves, and cause profound weakness that worsens after exertion. This work strengthens the evidence for the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial health in ME/CFS and suggests that targeting these pathways could be a future therapeutic strategy.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the molecular consequences of genetically reducing ATG13, a key protein involved in autophagy (the cell's quality control and recycling system). Using a mouse model, researchers explored how this depletion affects mitochondrial energy metabolism, inflammation in immune cells called macrophages, and the health of nerves within skeletal muscle, particularly in the context of post-exertional malaise (PEM).

## Why was it researched?

Previous research showed that disrupting the *atg13* gene in mice led to muscle weakness and nerve damage, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Given that ME/CFS is characterized by PEM, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune abnormalities, the researchers hypothesized that studying the effects of ATG13 depletion could provide a relevant animal model to better understand the molecular basis of the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a preclinical study using a genetically engineered mouse model with a partial deletion of the *atg13* gene ($Tg^{+/-ATG13}$). Researchers compared these mice to normal mice by isolating macrophages from their spleens and analyzing them with multiple lab techniques. They used seahorse assays to measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis, flow cytometry to determine the polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) types, and immunofluorescence to visualize proteins in tissue. Muscle function and fatigue were assessed using open-field behavioral tests and EMG recordings before and after a treadmill exercise challenge.

## What has been found?

The study found that reducing ATG13 impaired autophagy, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages, characterized by reduced ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). This metabolic defect caused the macrophages to shift to a pro-inflammatory M1 state. These inflammatory M1 macrophages were found to infiltrate the blood vessels in skeletal muscle, which was associated with damage to the myelin sheath of muscle-serving nerves. Critically, these energy metabolism deficits and the resulting muscle weakness were significantly exacerbated following a treadmill exercise challenge, mirroring the PEM experienced by patients.

## Discussion

The authors propose a novel mechanism where impaired autophagy, caused by ATG13 depletion, triggers a cascade of pathological events relevant to ME/CFS. They suggest that the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress lead to reduced activity of the deacetylase enzyme SIRT1, which in turn promotes a pro-inflammatory state via activation of NF-κB. This model connects the dots between a fundamental cellular process (autophagy), immune cell dysfunction (M1 polarization), and key symptoms like muscle fatigue and PEM.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the genetic depletion of ATG13 creates a robust model for inflammation-driven muscle fatigue, linking impaired autophagy to mitochondrial deficits, M1 macrophage polarization, and nerve demyelination. Their future work will involve studying M1/M2 polarization in immune cells derived from ME/CFS patients participating in a clinical trial of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin 💊, aiming to translate these findings from the mouse model to human patients.

## Summary

This landmark study, the largest of its kind for ME/CFS, provides the first strong scientific evidence that the illness has a clear biological basis rooted in genetics. The findings link ME/CFS risk to specific genes involved in the immune system's response to infection and genes active in the brain, aligning with the common patient experience of post-viral onset and neurological symptoms like pain and brain fog. By identifying a genetic link to chronic pain but not to depression, this research offers crucial biological evidence that distinguishes ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions. This provides a vital foundation for future research to develop objective diagnostic markers and targeted treatments.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). By conducting a large genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers compared the DNA of thousands of ME/CFS patients with a large population of healthy controls to find genetic risk factors that could point to the underlying biological mechanisms of the disease.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a common, disabling illness with no known cause, diagnostic test, or effective treatments. Previous genetic studies have been too small to produce robust and replicable findings. Identifying genetic risk factors is a high research priority for patients and is considered a critical step toward developing diagnostics and effective therapies.

## How was it researched?

This was a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) co-produced by scientists and people with ME/CFS. The study recruited participants from the UK, collecting DNA from saliva samples. The final analysis compared the DNA of 15,579 ME/CFS cases of European ancestry against 259,909 healthy controls from the UK Biobank, using stringent case criteria that required a professional diagnosis and the presence of post-exertional malaise.

## What has been found?

The study discovered eight distinct genetic loci (regions in the genome) that are significantly associated with ME/CFS. Three of these loci are located near genes involved in the immune response to infection (BTN2A2, OLFM4, and RABGAP1L). One locus, near the gene CA10, shares a common genetic signal with multisite chronic pain. Importantly, the study found no evidence that these genetic risk factors for ME/CFS are shared with depression or anxiety.

## Discussion

The authors attribute the study's success to its high statistical power, achieved through its large size, and its use of stringent case-definition criteria requiring post-exertional malaise. They note that the findings were not replicated in other large biobank analyses, which they suggest could be due to differences in how cases were defined in those cohorts (i.e., not strictly requiring ME/CFS's hallmark symptom). The study was limited to common genetic variants in people of European ancestry, and the authors state the need for further research in more diverse populations and for rarer genetic variants.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that this study provides the first robust evidence that common genetic variation contributes to the risk of developing ME/CFS, indicating that both immunological and neurological processes are involved in its pathology. These findings provide a firm biological foundation for ME/CFS research, which should help reduce stigma and accelerate the search for treatments. Future work will include analyzing DNA from all genetic ancestries, fine-mapping the identified genetic regions, and sequencing whole genomes to search for rare variants.

## Summary

This review provides a comprehensive biological argument for why metformin, a drug for type 2 diabetes, might be an effective treatment for ME/CFS and Long COVID. It connects the drug's known ability to improve cellular energy production, reduce oxidative stress, and calm inflammation directly to the core dysfunctions researchers have identified in patients. The paper highlights that metformin's potential is not just theoretical; a large clinical study has already shown it can significantly reduce the risk of developing Long COVID. This suggests metformin could become a valuable, evidence-based tool for treating the underlying metabolic problems in these conditions, though further trials are needed to confirm its efficacy for those already ill.

## What was researched?

This paper reviews the existing scientific evidence for using metformin 💊, a widely prescribed antidiabetic drug, as a potential treatment for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID (LC). The authors assessed how metformin's known mechanisms of action could target the underlying biological dysfunctions observed in these conditions.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS and Long COVID are debilitating post-infectious illnesses with no approved, effective treatments. There is a critical need to identify therapies that can address the core pathophysiology, which is believed to involve widespread dysfunction in cellular energy metabolism, the immune system, the gut microbiome, and the vascular system. This review was conducted to explore the therapeutic potential of repurposing metformin, as its effects align with many of these dysfunctional pathways.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review. The authors synthesized findings from a wide range of previous research, including laboratory (*in vitro*) studies, animal models, and clinical trials. They connected metformin's known effects on cellular pathways—such as the electron transport chain, mTOR signaling, and inflammation—to the specific pathological findings documented in ME/CFS and LC research.

## What has been found?

The review consolidates evidence that metformin acts on multiple systems relevant to ME/CFS and LC. It can inhibit mitochondrial complexes I and IV, which may reduce the production of damaging free radicals and lessen the strain on the dysfunctional complex V observed in ME/CFS cells. The drug also modulates the mTOR pathway to improve energy regulation, exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, stabilizes mast cells, and beneficially alters the gut microbiome. Notably, a major clinical trial found that metformin taken during an acute COVID-19 infection reduced the incidence of Long COVID by 41%.

## Discussion

The authors propose that metformin is unlikely to be a single cure but could be a key component of a multi-faceted treatment strategy. They suggest that future treatment approaches should target different domains of the illness simultaneously, using metformin to address cellular stress and microbiome issues while other therapies target autonomic and neurocognitive impairments. The significant gastrointestinal side effects of metformin are a noted complication, though evidence suggests much of the drug's benefit may come from its action within the gut itself.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that metformin is an intriguing, multi-action drug with a strong rationale for use in ME/CFS and LC. Its ability to regulate metabolism, reduce cellular damage, and restore gut health is expected to offer meaningful symptomatic relief. They recommend future research should focus on multi-arm randomized controlled trials to determine optimal dosing and delivery methods (such as delayed-release preparations) specifically for the ME/CFS and LC populations.

## Summary

This research identifies the hormone FGF-21 as a potential key for unlocking the biological differences between subgroups of ME and FM patients. The study suggests that both abnormally low and abnormally high levels of FGF-21 are linked to specific symptom patterns, but these links change depending on whether a patient has ME, FM, or both. For example, high FGF-21 was associated with better cognition in ME-only patients but worse physical fatigue in those with both ME and FM. This work provides a framework for classifying patients beyond simple diagnostic labels, which could lead to personalized treatments. The authors discuss several potential therapies to either boost low FGF-21 levels with drugs like metformin 💊 or FGF-21 analogues like efruxifermin 💊, or to address hormone resistance in high-FGF-21 states with agents like PPARy agonists 💊 or senolytics 💊.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the levels of a stress-responsive metabolic hormone called Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) in the blood of patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), Fibromyalgia (FM), and both conditions (ME+FM). The researchers aimed to determine if FGF-21 levels could serve as a biomarker to identify distinct patient subgroups based on their specific symptom patterns and cognitive function.

## Why was it researched?

ME and FM lack objective biomarkers, which complicates diagnosis, treatment, and research. Since FGF-21 is linked to metabolic dysfunction and mitochondrial stress—processes thought to be involved in these illnesses—it was considered a promising candidate biomarker. Previous smaller studies yielded inconsistent results, necessitating this larger, more comprehensive investigation to clarify FGF-21's role and its potential for stratifying patients into more precise clinical subtypes.

## How was it researched?

This was a cross-sectional study involving 250 patients (99 with ME, 47 with FM, 104 with ME+FM) and 54 healthy controls. Diagnoses were confirmed using a validated microRNA panel. Researchers measured plasma FGF-21 levels and categorized all participants into low, normal, or high FGF-21 groups. Symptom severity and cognitive function were assessed using validated questionnaires (DSQ, DPEMQ, SF-36, MFI-20) and the BrainCheck cognitive testing platform, with PEM being assessed after a standardized mechanical provocation test.

## What has been found?

Plasma FGF-21 levels were significantly elevated in patients with ME and ME+FM compared to healthy controls, but not in those with FM alone. More importantly, stratifying patients by their FGF-21 levels revealed distinct clinical profiles that varied by diagnosis. Low FGF-21 levels were associated with more severe PEM and immune/autonomic symptoms in ME patients and with poorer mental health in ME+FM patients. Conversely, high FGF-21 levels correlated with better cognitive performance in the ME group, but with worse physical fatigue in the ME+FM group.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the study's main strength is its large, well-characterized cohort and the stratification by FGF-21 levels, which revealed complex, phenotype-specific correlations. High FGF-21 may represent a protective compensatory mechanism in some ME patients, but could indicate systemic overload or hormone resistance in ME+FM patients. A key limitation is the cross-sectional design, which cannot establish causality. The study also noted discrepancies between self-reported and provocation-based PEM assessments, underscoring the need for objective PEM measurement tools.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that circulating FGF-21 is a nuanced and promising biomarker for ME and FM, capable of stratifying patients into subgroups with distinct symptom and cognitive profiles. This finding supports a move towards personalized medicine by identifying patients who might benefit from different therapeutic strategies. The authors call for future longitudinal studies and clinical trials to validate these subgroups and to test whether modulating FGF-21 signaling can improve patient outcomes.

## Summary

This study provides direct laboratory evidence that antibodies (IgG) from ME/CFS patients can damage the mitochondria—the energy factories—of healthy cells. This reinforces the theory that ME/CFS is an autoimmune disease and offers a potential biological explanation for the profound energy impairment experienced by patients. The research also uncovered key differences between ME/CFS and Long COVID (PASC) at a molecular level; ME/CFS appears linked to issues with the structural support around cells (extracellular matrix), while PASC is more associated with blood clotting pathways. These findings could pave the way for developing more specific diagnostic tests and treatments aimed at correcting these antibody-driven problems.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether immunoglobulins (specifically IgG antibodies) isolated from the blood of ME/CFS and PASC (Long COVID) patients could directly cause mitochondrial dysfunction in healthy human cells. The researchers examined the effects of these patient-derived IgGs on mitochondrial structure, cellular energy production, and the secretion of inflammatory markers, and also analyzed the composition of proteins bound to the IgGs.

## Why was it researched?

Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune system abnormalities are known features of ME/CFS, but the direct cause linking them is not fully understood. Previous research suggested an autoimmune component, as transferring IgG from patients to mice could induce symptoms. This study aimed to test the hypothesis *in vitro* (in a lab dish) that IgG from patients is a direct driver of the mitochondrial and metabolic problems seen in the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was an *in vitro* laboratory study using purified IgG antibodies from the blood serum of ME/CFS patients (n=40), PASC patients (n=16), multiple sclerosis patients (n=11), and healthy controls (n=39). The researchers exposed healthy human endothelial cells (HUVECs) to these IgGs and used microscopy to observe changes in mitochondrial structure. They measured cellular energy metabolism using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer and also exposed healthy immune cells (PBMCs) to the IgGs to measure inflammatory cytokine release. Finally, they used mass spectrometry to identify the proteins that were bound to the patient IgGs, a technique called immune complex proteomics.

## What has been found?

IgG from a subgroup of ME/CFS and PASC patients caused significant fragmentation of mitochondria in healthy endothelial cells, an effect that was more pronounced with IgG from female patients. While intact IgG was required for fragmentation, its separated 'Fab' fragment alone could alter cellular energy production by increasing maximal respiration, indicating cellular stress. In contrast, the 'Fc' fragment induced a hypometabolic state. Proteomic analysis revealed that ME/CFS immune complexes were enriched with proteins related to extracellular matrix organization, whereas PASC immune complexes were linked to hemostasis (blood clotting regulation).

## Discussion

The authors note the complexity of the findings, where different parts of the IgG molecule (Fab vs. Fc) have distinct effects on cellular energy, and the intact molecule is needed to cause mitochondrial fragmentation. They discuss that the entry of IgG into endothelial cells is a key step, likely mediated by Fc receptors and other non-specific pathways, which could be a pathogenic mechanism in ME/CFS. The distinct protein signatures found in the immune complexes of ME/CFS versus PASC suggest that while the conditions may share symptoms, they may be driven by different underlying biological processes.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that IgG from ME/CFS and PASC patients can directly cause mitochondrial fragmentation and metabolic dysregulation in healthy cells, providing a potential pathogenic mechanism for these diseases. The differing protein compositions of immune complexes in ME/CFS and PASC may serve as disease-specific biomarkers. The authors suggest these findings support targeting antibody-mediated pathology as a potential therapeutic strategy for post-infectious illnesses.

## Summary

This study introduces a novel blood analysis technique, called RNA liquid biopsy, that identifies distinct patterns of genetic material (cfRNA) in the blood of ME/CFS patients. The findings strongly support the theory of immune system dysregulation, revealing signals of T cell exhaustion, chronic inflammation, and altered activity in monocytes and dendritic cells. By applying machine learning to these cfRNA patterns, the researchers developed a promising, though not yet perfect, model that could distinguish patients from controls with 77% accuracy. This work represents a significant step towards a much-needed objective, blood-based diagnostic test and provides new molecular evidence reinforcing that ME/CFS is a biological illness rooted in the immune system.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are small pieces of genetic material released by cells into the bloodstream, could be used as a minimally invasive tool to diagnose ME/CFS and to better understand its underlying biology. The researchers aimed to identify cfRNA patterns specific to ME/CFS and use them to build a diagnostic model.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS lacks clinically validated biomarkers for an objective diagnosis, forcing reliance on subjective symptom evaluation. Previous research has pointed towards immune system dysregulation in the disease, but the biological mechanisms are poorly understood. The researchers explored cfRNA as a promising "liquid biopsy" tool because it can reflect dynamic changes in gene expression and cellular processes throughout the body, and has been successful in diagnosing other complex inflammatory diseases.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study that analyzed plasma samples from 93 ME/CFS patients and 75 healthy, sedentary controls. The researchers performed RNA sequencing on the cfRNA isolated from the plasma. They then used computational and machine learning methods to identify cfRNA transcripts that were different between the two groups and trained a diagnostic model to distinguish patients from controls. Additionally, they used a bioinformatic deconvolution technique to estimate the cellular origins of the cfRNA signals.

## What has been found?

The study identified 743 unique cfRNA features that differed significantly between ME/CFS cases and controls. A machine learning model (GLMNET Lasso) using a signature of 21 cfRNA genes was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with 77% accuracy and a test-set AUC of 0.81. Analysis of the cfRNA's cellular origins revealed significant differences in immune cell contributions, with ME/CFS patients showing elevated cfRNA from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and T cells, but decreased cfRNA from platelets. Pathway analysis further implicated immune dysfunction, highlighting signatures of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammatory signaling in patients.

## Discussion

The authors note that the diagnostic model's performance varied among individuals, and this variability was correlated with the amount of platelet-derived cfRNA, suggesting a true biological difference in platelet function in ME/CFS. A key limitation of the study is that it only analyzed samples taken at baseline, without provoking symptoms through an exercise challenge. The authors state that future work is needed to validate the findings in larger patient cohorts to account for disease heterogeneity and improve the model's robustness.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that cfRNA analysis is a valuable, minimally invasive tool for investigating the biology of ME/CFS, providing strong evidence for widespread immune dysregulation in the disease. They suggest that future studies should investigate cfRNA dynamics during post-exertional malaise (PEM) to gain further insight. Expanding the cohort size will be crucial for improving the generalizability and accuracy of cfRNA-based biomarkers for ME/CFS diagnosis and characterization.

## Summary

This research provides a potential physical explanation for the blood flow abnormalities and oxygen delivery problems often reported in ME/CFS. It suggests that the red blood cells themselves are less able to respond to the body's demand for oxygen, which could contribute to symptoms like post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction. The "velocity slope" measurement developed in this study is a promising candidate for a much-needed objective diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS. Furthermore, the *in vitro* success of two existing drugs in correcting this RBC dysfunction offers a new, targeted avenue for the development of future treatments aimed at improving microcirculation, though these findings are preliminary and require much more research.

## What was researched?

This study investigated how red blood cells (RBCs) from individuals with ME/CFS change their speed in tiny, capillary-like channels in response to varying oxygen levels ($PO_2$). The researchers explored whether these measurements could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS and be used to evaluate the effects of potential therapeutic drugs.

## Why was it researched?

Previous research has consistently shown that ME/CFS patients have impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the underlying cause is unclear. Based on prior findings that RBCs actively regulate capillary blood flow in response to local oxygen demand, the researchers hypothesized that RBC function might be compromised in ME/CFS, contributing to these blood flow abnormalities. This study aimed to test that hypothesis by directly measuring RBC behavior under controlled oxygen conditions.

## How was it researched?

This was an *ex vivo* laboratory study using microfluidic devices to mimic blood capillaries. The researchers analyzed blood samples from a cohort of 35 ME/CFS patients and 23 healthy controls. They measured the velocity of isolated RBCs as they passed through the micro-channels at four different oxygen tensions ($PO_2$), from normal to hypoxic levels. The resulting data were analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to assess their diagnostic potential. The team also incubated RBCs from ME/CFS patients with two drugs to see if their function could be improved.

## What has been found?

The study found that RBCs from ME/CFS patients have an impaired response to low oxygen. While healthy RBCs sped up significantly as oxygen dropped, ME/CFS RBCs showed a much smaller increase in velocity. The "velocity slope," which measures this sensitivity to oxygen changes, was significantly lower in the ME/CFS group and proved to be a robust biomarker. A machine learning model using this slope feature was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (77.8%), sensitivity (76%), and specificity (90%). Additionally, treating ME/CFS RBCs with salmeterol xinafoate 💊 and xanomeline 💊 improved their velocity in response to low oxygen in this lab setting.

## Discussion

The authors note that the impaired RBC response to low oxygen may be caused by known cellular issues in ME/CFS, such as reduced RBC deformability and increased oxidative stress. They highlight that dynamic measurements, like testing the response to a stressor like hypoxia, appear more effective for diagnosis than static measurements. The primary limitation acknowledged in the paper is the relatively small sample size, which necessitates further validation in larger patient cohorts.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that RBCs from ME/CFS patients exhibit significantly impaired capillary velocity in response to reduced oxygen levels, revealing a previously unrecognized role for RBCs in the disease's pathophysiology. This RBC-based microfluidic method presents a novel and potentially effective approach for ME/CFS classification and assessment. The research is ongoing with plans to continue with a larger patient cohort to improve the detection accuracy and ease of use.

## Summary

This review provides a compelling framework that connects the wide range of physical problems found in ME/CFS and Long COVID (such as immune dysfunction, mitochondrial issues, and viral persistence) to a central mechanism in the brain. It proposes that these different issues all contribute to brain inflammation, which in turn activates a primitive "sickness program" responsible for generating core symptoms like profound fatigue and cognitive difficulties. The illness persists because these biological problems create self-sustaining vicious cycles. This model suggests that future treatments aimed at calming brain inflammation could offer a powerful way to manage the symptoms for a broad range of patients.

## What was researched?

This review article explores how the various underlying biological abnormalities identified in both long COVID and ME/CFS lead to the illnesses' characteristic symptoms and why these symptoms persist for years. The authors propose that in addition to direct causes, symptoms may also arise from the activation of ancient, evolutionarily conserved responses to vital threats, specifically "sickness behavior" and "torpor," which are mediated by specific neural circuits.

## Why was it researched?

While many biological abnormalities (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, autoantibodies) have been found in both long COVID and ME/CFS, the precise mechanisms linking these issues to the generation and chronicity of symptoms remain unclear. This review aims to synthesize recent discoveries to explain how these diverse pathologies might converge on a common pathway in the brain, offering a more unified understanding of the diseases.

## How was it researched?

This paper is a literature review. The authors synthesized and analyzed findings from numerous existing research articles on long COVID, ME/CFS, immunology, and neuroscience. They used this evidence to construct a comprehensive model explaining how neuroinflammation, triggered by various peripheral abnormalities, could activate specific neural circuits in the brain to produce a stereotyped set of sickness symptoms and metabolic changes.

## What has been found?

The authors argue that symptoms are caused both directly by various pathologies and indirectly through a central mechanism: neuroinflammation. This neuroinflammation, triggered by factors like persistent viral antigens or gut dysbiosis, is proposed to stimulate newly discovered neural circuits in the brainstem and hypothalamus. These circuits then orchestrate evolutionarily ancient, energy-preserving responses known as "sickness behavior" and a "torpor-like" hypometabolic state, manifesting as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and malaise. The illness becomes chronic due to persistent triggers (like viral reservoirs) and the creation of self-perpetuating "vicious cycles," where different biological abnormalities reinforce one another.

## Discussion

The authors propose that a "single lesion" is unlikely to be the sole cause of these complex illnesses. Their model's strength lies in providing a unifying explanation where diverse peripheral issues converge on a central symptom-generating pathway in the brain. They suggest that while targeting each individual abnormality is a valid therapeutic approach, it may be more effective to target the central driver of neuroinflammation that activates these sickness-mediating neural circuits.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the symptoms and metabolic changes in long COVID and ME/CFS are likely driven by neuroinflammation activating specific brain circuits that control sickness behavior. The chronicity is maintained by persistent triggers and interlocking "vicious cycles" of pathology. They suggest that future therapeutic strategies should focus on developing novel treatments that can precisely quell neuroinflammation, which may alleviate many of the core symptoms of these illnesses.

## Summary

This large-scale review provides a ranked comparison of non-drug treatments for depression in ME/CFS, a major comorbidity of the disease. The findings suggest that interventions like a specific diet (polyphenol-rich chocolate) and traditional therapies like moxibustion may be more effective than exercise or psychotherapy for these specific symptoms. While the evidence for the top-ranked diet therapy is still preliminary and requires more robust research, this analysis offers a valuable evidence-based starting point for patients and clinicians exploring alternatives to antidepressants for managing depression in ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various non-pharmacological therapies for alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The researchers used a network meta-analysis to rank the different treatments against each other.

## Why was it researched?

Depression is a common and burdensome symptom in CFS, but standard drug treatments are often controversial and have significant side effects. While many non-drug therapies exist, their relative effectiveness was unclear, and there was a lack of high-quality evidence comparing them directly. This study was conducted to fill this research gap and provide evidence-based guidance for clinical decisions.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 47 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 4,028 patients. The researchers searched nine scientific databases for studies that investigated non-drug interventions such as diet therapy, acupuncture, moxibustion, psychotherapy, and various forms of exercise. Using a Bayesian statistical model, they integrated direct and indirect evidence from these trials to compare the efficacy of all treatments simultaneously.

## What has been found?

The analysis revealed that, compared to control measures, diet therapy 💊 (specifically polyphenol-rich chocolate) was the most effective intervention for improving depressive symptoms in CFS patients. This was followed by moxibustion (Mox) 💊, a form of traditional heat therapy, and combination therapies involving acupuncture and moxibustion. In contrast, four types of exercise therapy (aerobics, resistance training, relaxation therapy, Qigong) and psychotherapy did not show a statistically significant effect on improving depression scores in this analysis.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations. The included studies used different scales to measure depression, which could introduce variability. Most of the 47 studies were rated as having a medium risk of bias, and some interventions, including the top-ranked diet therapy, were supported by only a few studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, the authors advise that the results, particularly the strong effect of diet therapy, should be interpreted with caution.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that several non-pharmacological therapies, particularly diet therapy and moxibustion, appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in CFS patients. They strongly recommend that more high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and strengthen the evidence base for these promising non-drug treatments.

## Summary

This study explores a novel approach to treating Long COVID by using a first-in-class immunotherapy to "jump-start" the immune system. If successful, ANKTIVA® could help clear lingering viral proteins and restore healthy immune function in patients for whom traditional antivirals have failed. This marks a significant shift toward immune-enhancing strategies for chronic post-viral syndromes.

## What was researched?

This study evaluates the safety and immunological effects of ANKTIVA® 💊 (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) in individuals suffering from Long COVID.

## Why was it researched?

The research aims to address persistent viral reservoirs and immune dysregulation, specifically targeting the deficiency in Natural Killer (NK) and T cell activity often observed in Long COVID patients.

## How was it researched?

This is a Phase 2, exploratory, single-arm clinical trial involving up to 40 adult participants who meet the World Health Organization criteria for Long COVID. Participants receive subcutaneous injections of the IL-15 superagonist and undergo monitoring for adverse events and changes in absolute lymphocyte counts.

## What has been found?

As of late 2025, the trial has been initiated and is currently in the recruitment phase at clinical sites in California. Preliminary findings are not yet available, but researchers are tracking the drug's ability to improve post-COVID NK cell and CD8+ T cell counts and function.

## Discussion

The study's single-arm, open-label design is a limitation as it lacks a placebo control for comparison. However, the focus on objective biomarkers like lymphocyte counts provides a quantitative measure of the drug's biological activity in this patient population.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The trial focuses on whether immune modulation via IL-15 agonism can provide a new therapeutic pathway for chronic post-viral conditions. Future results will clarify if boosting NK cell response translates into effective viral clearance and symptom relief.

## Summary

This paper announces a major, well-designed German clinical trial (RAPID) to test treatments for Post Covid Syndrome, a condition with significant symptom overlap with ME/CFS. The first phase of the trial will test an antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug called vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) to see if it can improve physical function. This drug was chosen because it targets the widely held theory that persistent viral activity and chronic inflammation drive the illness. The trial's innovative "adaptive platform" design allows researchers to test multiple drugs more efficiently and is a significant step forward in the search for the first proven, effective treatments for post-viral diseases like PCS and potentially ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This paper describes the study protocol for RAPID, a large-scale, multicenter adaptive platform trial in Germany designed to evaluate various treatment options for Post Covid Syndrome (PCS). It specifically details the first intervention arm, called RAPID_REVIVE, which will assess the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) 💊 in improving physical function for patients with PCS.

## Why was it researched?

A significant portion of individuals who contract COVID-19 develop long-term symptoms known as PCS, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatment options available. The RAPID trial was established to address this urgent medical need by creating an efficient framework to test promising therapies. The first drug, vidofludimus calcium, was selected because it targets two leading hypotheses for the cause of PCS: persistent SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoirs or reactivation of other viruses like EBV, and the resulting chronic inflammation.

## How was it researched?

This document is a study protocol, outlining the methodology of a future clinical trial. RAPID_REVIVE is designed as a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to enroll 376 adults with moderate to severe PCS across 11 hospitals in Germany. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a daily oral dose of vidofludimus calcium or a placebo for a 56-day treatment period, followed by a 28-day follow-up. The primary outcome will be the change in physical function from baseline to day 56, as measured by the Short Form-36 Physical Function (SF-36-PF) questionnaire, with secondary endpoints assessing fatigue, cognitive symptoms, and other quality of life metrics.

## What has been found?

As this is a study protocol, it describes the plan for the research rather than its results. No findings have been generated yet. The trial was registered in March 2024, and the protocol indicates that patient recruitment was planned to begin in August 2024 and be completed by June 2025.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the significant advantages of the adaptive platform trial design. This modern approach is more efficient and flexible than traditional single-drug trials, allowing researchers to evaluate multiple interventions simultaneously, add new treatment arms as they emerge, and adapt the study based on incoming data. This is particularly valuable for a new and complex illness like PCS, where the scientific understanding is evolving rapidly and numerous treatment hypotheses need to be tested.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the RAPID platform trial is a crucial step toward establishing an evidence base for treating PCS, which currently does not exist. The first arm, RAPID_REVIVE, will investigate a promising antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, addressing core hypotheses of the disease's pathology. In the future, the overarching RAPID platform is designed to incorporate and evaluate additional interventions, aiming to accelerate the identification of effective treatments for this debilitating condition.

## Summary

This comprehensive guide provides German-speaking clinicians with a crucial, evidence-based framework for diagnosing and managing ME/CFS, which could significantly reduce diagnostic delays and prevent harmful treatments for patients. For patients, this document serves as an important validation of their illness as a severe, physical condition and outlines a management approach focused on stabilization and symptom control, particularly the avoidance of Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) through Pacing. The guide's detailed discussion of symptomatic off-label treatments and the management of common comorbidities like POTS and MCAS offers practical pathways for improving patients' quality of life while awaiting the development of curative therapies.

## What was researched?

This document is a comprehensive clinical practice guide for general practitioners on the diagnosis and management of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It synthesizes the current scientific understanding of the disease, including its pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnostic criteria, and therapeutic approaches, with a specific focus on ME/CFS following any trigger, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Why was it researched?

This guide was created to address the significant deficit in medical knowledge and the resulting inadequate care for ME/CFS patients in Germany, where diagnostic delays average 6-7 years. It aims to provide clinicians with an evidence-based, practical tool to correctly diagnose and manage this complex, severe neuroimmunological disease (ICD-10 G93.3), especially given the increasing number of patients since the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10-20% of Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) patients developing ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This document is a clinical guideline based on a comprehensive review of existing scientific literature, international diagnostic criteria (IOM, CCC), and established medical guidelines (e.g., NICE Guideline 2021). It consolidates expert consensus and evidence into a structured format for practical use in a clinical setting, rather than presenting new primary research from a specific patient cohort. The guide covers pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnostic procedures, symptom management, and socio-medical support.

## What has been found?

The guide establishes ME/CFS as a severe, chronic, multi-systemic disease characterized by pathomechanisms including dysregulation of the immune and autonomic nervous systems, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction. The cardinal symptom is Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), a pathological worsening of symptoms after minimal physical, cognitive, or emotional exertion. The guide provides detailed outlines of the multi-faceted symptoms (neurological, immunological, autonomic, neuroendocrine), diagnostic procedures, and common comorbidities such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and Small-Fiber Neuropathy (SFN).

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that ME/CFS is a biological, not a psychogenic, illness and that outdated concepts like Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) are contraindicated and harmful, often leading to severe and permanent deterioration. The guide highlights the immense disease burden, with quality of life often lower than in conditions like MS or stroke, and the significant stigmatization patients face in the healthcare system. The lack of a curative therapy or specific biomarkers is a major limitation, making diagnosis dependent on clinical criteria and exclusion of other conditions.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that management of ME/CFS must be centered on three pillars: 1) Energy management (Pacing) to prevent PEM, 2) symptomatic therapy to alleviate the most burdensome symptoms, and 3) diagnosis and treatment of comorbidities. They recommend several off-label medications for symptom control, including Pyridostigmin 💊 (Mestinon®), Low-Dose Naltrexone 💊 (LDN), and Low-Dose Aripiprazol 💊 (LDA). The guide implicitly calls for increased research to identify biomarkers and develop targeted treatments, as well as for improved education and specialized care structures within the healthcare system.

## Summary

This large-scale review of 118 studies consolidates the evidence that reduced blood flow to the brain is a common feature in both ME/CFS and orthostatic intolerance. The key finding for patients is that having both ME/CFS and OI (like POTS) appears to worsen this blood flow problem significantly. This provides a strong physiological basis for symptoms like brain fog, light-headedness, and post-exertional malaise, especially those triggered by being upright. By establishing reduced CBF as a consistent and measurable abnormality, this work strengthens the case for its use as a potential biomarker for disease severity and points towards future treatments aimed at improving cerebral circulation.

## What was researched?

This systematic review assessed existing research to determine if cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in patients with ME/CFS and/or orthostatic intolerance (OI). The researchers specifically investigated whether having both ME/CFS and OI at the same time leads to an even greater reduction in blood flow to the brain.

## Why was it researched?

A large proportion of people with ME/CFS experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, which are thought to be caused by decreased cerebral blood flow. This reduction in CBF may be a major contributing factor to the cognitive impairment known as 'brain fog'. This review aimed to synthesize the evidence from numerous studies to clarify the relationship between these conditions and CBF, potentially aiding future diagnosis and treatment.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic literature review that followed PRISMA guidelines. Researchers searched four major scientific databases for studies published up to February 14th, 2025, that measured CBF in ME/CFS, OI, or both. From an initial pool of 14,928 articles, 118 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were grouped into those focusing on ME/CFS alone (26 studies), OI alone (81 studies), or both conditions combined (11 studies), encompassing a total of 9,185 participants.

## What has been found?

The review found that CBF was significantly reduced in a substantial portion of studies focusing on ME/CFS alone (12 out of 26) and in a majority of studies on OI alone (56 out of 81) when compared to healthy controls. More importantly, a majority of the articles that directly compared ME/CFS patients with and without OI (4 out of 7) found that having both conditions resulted in a significantly larger decrease in CBF than having ME/CFS alone.

## Discussion

The authors noted several limitations, including the high variability in methods used to measure CBF across studies (e.g., MRI, TCD, SPECT), which made a direct meta-analysis impossible. They also highlighted that many ME/CFS studies did not screen for OI, which may have acted as a confounding factor. Furthermore, severely ill patients are often unable to participate in studies involving orthostatic challenges like tilt table tests, meaning the most affected segment of the patient population is likely underrepresented.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that cerebral blood flow is reduced in both ME/CFS and OI, and having both conditions comorbidly amplifies this reduction. They suggest that monitoring CBF could be a valuable tool for assessing disease severity in ME/CFS patients. The researchers emphasize that understanding how ME/CFS and OI interact to affect CBF is crucial for improving diagnosis and developing targeted therapies.

## Summary

This study provides the first evidence linking a specific genetic trait—the type of haptoglobin protein a person has—to the severity of post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction in ME. It suggests that exertion triggers a stress response in ME patients, possibly involving red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis), and that individuals with less efficient types of haptoglobin (like Hp2-1) are less able to manage this stress, leading to worse symptoms. This research identifies a robust candidate for a PEM biomarker, offers a potential biological explanation for why PEM severity varies between patients, and opens a new avenue for developing targeted therapies, such as supplementing the more protective form of the haptoglobin protein.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the protein haptoglobin (Hp) as a potential biomarker for post-exertional malaise (PEM) and cognitive dysfunction in ME. Researchers examined how different genetic types (phenotypes) and structural forms of Hp are associated with the severity of these hallmark symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

The molecular mechanisms driving PEM and cognitive issues in ME are still unknown. Based on emerging evidence of blood-related abnormalities and oxidative stress in the disease, the researchers hypothesized that haptoglobin, a key protein that protects against damage from hemoglobin released from red blood cells, might play a significant role. This study aimed to explore the link between Hp, PEM, and cognitive impairment.

## How was it researched?

This was a longitudinal case-control study involving a total of 140 ME patients and 44 healthy controls, split into two cohorts. In the first phase, researchers performed proteomic analysis on plasma samples from 61 ME patients and 20 controls before and after a standardized, non-invasive stress test designed to induce PEM. In the second phase, they validated these findings in a separate cohort of 89 ME patients and 24 controls using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze Hp concentration and structure, and correlated this with symptom severity and cognitive performance data.

## What has been found?

ME patients experienced a significant reduction in haptoglobin (Hp) levels after the stress test, a change not observed in healthy controls. The study revealed a genetic link to symptom severity: the Hp1-1 phenotype was associated with milder symptoms, while the Hp2-1 phenotype was more common in ME patients and linked to more severe PEM and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, ME patients with the Hp2-1 phenotype showed altered structural forms of the protein (an increase in larger oligomers), and the abundance of these forms correlated with PEM severity and cognitive impairment.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the strength of detecting significant Hp differences even after using a standard proteomic preparation step designed to remove it, suggesting that specific, structurally altered forms of Hp are retained and are pathologically relevant in ME. A primary limitation was the small number of patients with the protective Hp1-1 phenotype, which reduced statistical power for some comparisons. The inclusion of severely ill, housebound patients, who are often excluded from research, was noted as a strength, although the authors acknowledge that more time points would be needed to fully capture the dynamics of PEM.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a person's haptoglobin phenotype and its molecular structure modulate their physiological response to exertion in ME, providing a potential molecular explanation for PEM and its clinical variability. Hp is proposed as a promising biomarker for patient stratification and as a potential therapeutic target. Future work may explore phenotype-informed interventions, such as administering the more protective Hp1-1 form, to mitigate oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction in genetically susceptible ME patients.

## Summary

This symposium report is highly significant for ME/CFS patients as it strongly reinforces the autoimmune nature of the illness, centering on specific autoantibodies that disrupt critical cell receptors (GPCRs) responsible for regulating functions like blood pressure and immune response. It provides a plausible mechanism for how the illness can be triggered by a common infection, suggesting that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation can lead to these harmful autoantibodies through "molecular mimicry." By identifying these autoantibodies as active drivers of pathology, this research validates the biological basis of ME/CFS symptoms and paves the way for developing objective diagnostic tests and targeted treatments, such as therapies to remove or neutralize these antibodies.

## What was researched?

This paper summarizes the key insights and advancements presented at the 5th International Symposium on Regulatory Autoantibodies Targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (RAB-GPCRs). It explores the active role of these autoantibodies in various human diseases, including ME/CFS and post-COVID syndrome (PCS), and discusses their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

## Why was it researched?

This report was compiled to consolidate the growing body of evidence that RAB-GPCRs, once considered passive markers, are in fact active modulators of cellular signaling, immune regulation, and inflammation. The symposium aimed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and highlight this paradigm shift, discussing the involvement of these autoantibodies in a wide range of pathologies, from autoimmune diseases to post-viral syndromes.

## How was it researched?

This article is a comprehensive review and report of a scientific symposium. It synthesizes the presentations and discussions of leading experts from rheumatology, immunology, and neurology. The report draws upon numerous cited studies to construct a cohesive overview of the current understanding and future directions in RAB-GPCR research.

## What has been found?

The report highlights that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are significantly involved in ME/CFS and PCS. One major finding discussed is that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation may be a key trigger, as certain EBV proteins contain sequences that mimic human GPCRs (molecular mimicry), leading to the production of cross-reactive autoantibodies. These autoantibodies, particularly those targeting adrenergic receptors, are associated with symptom severity in ME/CFS/PCS and are thought to contribute directly to symptoms like dysautonomia, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize the major shift in understanding these autoantibodies, from being viewed as simple disease markers to being recognized as dynamic, functionally active agents. They discuss that these molecules can have both regulatory roles in health and pathogenic roles in disease, depending on factors like their concentration and specificity. This complexity challenges traditional immunological frameworks and calls for new conceptual models.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that functional autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are central players in the mechanisms of many immune-mediated and post-viral diseases. They strongly advocate for future research to adopt integrative, systems-level approaches that combine autoantibody profiling with other biological data (multi-omics). Such work is expected to uncover shared disease mechanisms and accelerate the development of precision diagnostics and immunomodulatory therapies.

## Summary

This theoretical review paper proposes a compelling new explanation for the complex, multi-system nature of ME/CFS. It suggests that tiny particles called exosomes transport regulatory molecules (LncRNAs) between cells throughout the body, potentially spreading dysfunction and causing the hallmark symptoms of the illness, such as immune abnormalities and energy failure. By identifying specific LncRNAs involved in these processes, this work lays the groundwork for developing the first objective, molecular biomarkers for ME/CFS, which could lead to definitive diagnostic tests. While still a hypothesis, this provides a unified theory that connects many disparate findings in ME/CFS research.

## What was researched?

This paper reviews the potential association between long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) carried within exosomes (tiny vesicles that travel between cells) and the development of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The authors explore the scientific hypothesis that these exosomal LncRNAs (EV-LncRNAs) could serve as a molecular link between the various system-wide abnormalities seen in CFS and act as potential biomarkers for diagnosis.

## Why was it researched?

The underlying cause (pathogenesis) of CFS is unknown, and there are currently no effective treatments or specific diagnostic biomarkers. Researchers hypothesized that EV-LncRNAs, which are known to regulate gene expression and mediate communication between cells, might be involved in the multi-system dysfunction characteristic of CFS, including immune, neuroendocrine, and metabolic problems.

## How was it researched?

This study is a systematic literature review. The authors did not conduct new experiments but instead synthesized existing research from immunology, molecular biology, and neurology to build a theoretical framework. They analyzed the known functions of various LncRNAs and connected them to the established pathological features of CFS, such as immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the effects of viral infections.

## What has been found?

The review proposes several specific mechanisms by which LncRNAs could contribute to CFS pathology. For instance, dysregulation of certain LncRNAs (e.g., `linc-MAF-4`, `GATA3-AS1`) could explain the T-cell imbalances and chronic inflammation, while others (e.g., `glycoLINC`, `H19`, `ROSALIND`) could be responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism deficits seen in patients. The authors highlight a previous study that found significantly increased levels of three immune-related LncRNAs in the blood cells of CFS patients, supporting their potential as disease biomarkers.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation of their work is the scarcity of studies directly investigating LncRNAs in CFS. The connections proposed are largely hypothetical and based on indirect evidence from research in other diseases. Therefore, a direct causal relationship has not been established and requires future experimental validation to overcome potential biases from existing datasets.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that EV-LncRNAs represent a promising and previously unexplored area of CFS research, potentially serving as the molecular messengers that link the disease's diverse pathologies. They strongly advocate for future research to focus on validating these molecules as clinical biomarkers. They recommend large-scale, multicenter studies using advanced methods like single-cell sequencing to confirm their hypotheses and better understand the role of EV-LncRNAs in CFS.

## Summary

This study provides evidence for a specific autoimmune mechanism in ME/CFS and Post-COVID Syndrome, where the immune system may attack the body's own proteins because they resemble parts of the Epstein-Barr virus. Researchers identified several specific human proteins involved in autonomic, vascular, and neurological function that are targeted by these cross-reactive antibodies. The direct correlation found between the levels of these autoantibodies and the severity of key symptoms like autonomic dysfunction and cognitive issues strengthens the theory that autoimmunity is a significant driver of the illness. This work identifies potential new biomarkers for diagnosis and points toward future treatments that could target these specific autoimmune pathways.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether antibodies targeting specific parts of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) also react with similar-looking human proteins in women with Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). The researchers focused on antibody reactivity to arginine-rich (poly-R) sequences from EBV proteins and their human counterparts, and whether these antibody levels were associated with clinical symptoms.

## Why was it researched?

EBV is a known trigger for ME/CFS and EBV reactivation is a risk factor for PCS. Previous studies by the same research group found that ME/CFS patients have elevated antibody responses to specific arginine-rich parts of EBV proteins. This led to the hypothesis that the immune system, when targeting these viral parts, might mistakenly attack human proteins with similar sequences—a mechanism called molecular mimicry—which could contribute to the autoimmune symptoms seen in both conditions.

## How was it researched?

This was a laboratory study analyzing blood serum from a cohort of 115 female participants: 45 with PCS (26 of whom also met ME/CFS criteria), 36 with post-infectious ME/CFS not triggered by COVID (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls. The researchers used a cytometric bead array (CBA) to measure IgG antibody binding to short peptide sequences from EBV and homologous human proteins. They also used a multiplex dot-blot assay to measure IgG binding to the corresponding full-length proteins and correlated these antibody levels with symptom severity data from patient questionnaires.

## What has been found?

Autoantibodies targeting arginine-rich sequences of several human proteins were found more frequently in the patient groups than in healthy controls. These proteins included the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, the signaling regulator TSPYL2, and the angiogenesis-related protein TSPYL5. Additionally, autoantibodies against full-length α-adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more common in patients. Crucially, the levels of several of these autoantibodies showed positive correlations with the severity of core symptoms, including autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations of this exploratory study, including the relatively small cohort sizes and the restriction to only female participants, which means the findings require validation in larger, more diverse patient groups. They also note that their selection of human proteins to test was based on their potential relevance to ME/CFS symptoms, which may have introduced a bias and excluded other important autoantigens.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that patients with PCS and ME/CFS have a higher frequency of autoantibodies directed against human proteins that contain sequences mimicking those in EBV. The association between these autoantibodies and symptom severity suggests they are functionally relevant and supports the hypothesis that molecular mimicry plays a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. These findings warrant further investigation to confirm the pathogenic role of these autoantibodies and to explore their potential use as diagnostic markers.

## Summary

This study is a major step in validating the experiences of patients by officially categorizing the various ways Long COVID manifests. By identifying a specific "general fatigue" subtype and a "neurological" subtype (including brain fog and memory issues), the research aligns closely with the clinical presentations seen in ME/CFS. The finding that prevalence remains high—or even increases—at the two-year mark suggests that the condition is not merely a slow recovery but a persistent chronic illness for millions. This emphasizes the need for long-term clinical support and targeted research into the distinct biological pathways of each subtype to develop effective diagnostics and therapies.

## What was researched?

This mega-systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the global prevalence of Long COVID and identify its specific clinical subtypes (phenotypes) and risk factors. The researchers sought to synthesize data from hundreds of studies to provide a unified understanding of how common the condition is and how it manifests in different symptom clusters.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a highly heterogeneous condition, meaning it presents differently in different people, which makes diagnosis and treatment difficult. While previous reviews focused on individual symptoms or specific populations, this study was prompted by the need for an updated, comprehensive analysis that accounts for the evolution of the virus (from Alpha to Omicron) and the impact of widespread vaccination.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a systematic review of 8,515 unique publications from July 2021 to July 2024, eventually including 429 studies in their final analysis. They used a random-effects statistical framework to pool data on prevalence and risk factors from a global cohort of millions of patients. The study categorized symptoms into eight physiological subtypes (e.g., neurological, respiratory, general fatigue) and analyzed the protective effects of any vaccination 💊 against developing the condition.

## What has been found?

The study found a global Long COVID prevalence of 36% among those with a confirmed infection, with symptoms persisting in 46% of cases at the 1–2 year follow-up mark. Eight distinct subtypes were identified, with the most prevalent being respiratory (20%), general fatigue (20%), psychological (18%), and neurological (16%). Notably, memory problems were reported in 11% of patients. The analysis also confirmed that being unvaccinated significantly increased the risk of Long COVID, with unvaccinated individuals showing more than double the odds (OR 2.09) of developing the condition compared to those who received a vaccination 💊.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the immense heterogeneity of the data, noting that different definitions of Long COVID and varying study designs contribute to a high degree of statistical variation. They discuss the potential for "ever" experiencing symptoms to be high, even as some individual symptoms might resolve. A significant limitation identified is the lack of data from Africa and parts of Asia, which may skew global estimates.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that Long COVID is a significant and persistent global health burden that requires standardized clinical definitions and subtype-specific diagnostic tools. They suggest that future research should focus on longitudinal studies to track these subtypes over many years and investigate the biological mechanisms unique to each symptom cluster, particularly for the neurological and fatigue-based phenotypes.

## Summary

This study provides new genetic evidence supporting the theory of immune dysregulation in ME/CFS. It suggests that specific, inherited variations in genes that regulate Natural Killer (NK) cell function may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to the disease. While not a diagnostic tool, this research pinpoints specific immune pathways that may be dysfunctional in patients. These findings could help guide future research into the biological mechanisms of ME/CFS and potentially identify targets for future treatments, but first, they must be validated in larger international studies.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether specific genetic variations, known as alleles, in the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes are associated with ME/CFS. KIRs are receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells that help regulate their function.

## Why was it researched?

Previous research has pointed to immune system dysfunction in ME/CFS, particularly abnormal function of NK cells. However, smaller, earlier studies on KIR genes in ME/CFS patients produced conflicting results. This larger, high-resolution study was needed to clarify whether genetic variations in these immune-regulating genes are linked to the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a genetic association study that analyzed DNA samples from 418 Norwegian ME/CFS patients and 473 healthy controls. The researchers used high-resolution next-generation sequencing to identify the specific alleles of KIR genes present in each participant. They also included Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) data to assess the interaction between KIR receptors and their corresponding ligands.

## What has been found?

The study found no significant association between ME/CFS and the overall presence or number of copies of KIR genes. However, the data suggested an association with specific alleles of genes that code for *inhibitory* KIRs. Three alleles (KIR3DL3*002, KIR3DL1*020, and KIR3DL2*009) were significantly more frequent in patients, while two alleles (KIR3DL3*013 and KIR3DL2*010) were significantly less frequent.

## Discussion

The authors note that this is the largest KIR genetic study in ME/CFS to date. They acknowledge that their findings require replication in even larger cohorts to be confirmed, as only one of the allele associations would remain statistically significant after applying a very strict correction for multiple comparisons. The findings do, however, align with the theory of NK cell dysfunction in ME/CFS, as the associated alleles are all on genes for inhibitory receptors which directly control NK cell activity.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that their data suggest certain alleles of inhibitory KIR genes are associated with ME/CFS, supporting the involvement of NK cells in the disease's development. They state that these findings warrant replication in larger patient cohorts to establish robust genetic associations.

## Summary

This review consolidates evidence that nutrition is a crucial component in managing Long COVID, a condition with significant overlap with ME/CFS, particularly concerning immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The findings suggest that specific dietary changes—such as adopting a Mediterranean diet or using supplements like Vitamin D/K2, omega-3s, and probiotics—can target the chronic inflammation and gut health issues that may drive persistent symptoms. This research reinforces the potential for personalized nutrition to be a supportive tool for improving fatigue, brain fog, and overall well-being in post-viral illness, while highlighting the urgent need for more rigorous studies to create standardized treatment guidelines.

## What was researched?

This paper provides a narrative review of the existing research on the relationship between nutrition, lifestyle, and Long COVID. The authors aimed to synthesize current knowledge on how dietary interventions, specific nutrients, and physical rehabilitation can help manage the persistent symptoms of Long COVID and to highlight the need for effective nutritional care protocols.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID presents a significant global health challenge, with symptoms spanning multiple organ systems and often involving mitochondrial and immune system dysregulation, similar to other post-viral syndromes. As nutritional interventions have gained attention for managing such conditions, this review was conducted to consolidate the evidence on how diet and lifestyle modifications could specifically address the complex pathophysiology of Long COVID.

## How was it researched?

This study was a narrative literature review. The authors gathered and analyzed a wide range of existing research, including observational studies and randomized controlled trials, to summarize the current understanding of Long COVID's impact on the body. They evaluated the evidence for various interventions, such as supplementation with vitamins and minerals, whole-diet approaches like the Mediterranean diet, the use of probiotics, and the role of tailored exercise programs in patient recovery.

## What has been found?

The review found substantial evidence that targeted nutritional strategies can help manage Long COVID symptoms by addressing underlying issues like inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids 💊, Vitamin D 💊, Vitamin K2 💊, and minerals like magnesium 💊 and zinc 💊 showed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Probiotics 💊 and prebiotics were found to help restore gut health, which is linked to systemic inflammation, while lactoferrin 💊 may help manage iron dysregulation. Additionally, whole-food dietary patterns and phytochemicals like curcumin 💊 and quercetin 💊 demonstrated promise in reducing inflammation and supporting recovery.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that a major challenge in treating Long COVID is the wide variety of symptoms among patients, which makes a single, universal nutritional approach impractical. They note that the evidence base for many treatments is still developing, limited by variations in clinical trial design, sample sizes, and follow-up periods. Therefore, individualized and personalized dietary counseling is essential for effective management.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that nutritional interventions offer a valuable integrative approach to manage the malnutrition, chronic inflammation, and metabolic issues seen in Long COVID. They stress that while promising, significant challenges remain in determining the optimal dosage, duration, and combination of supplements for patients. Further high-quality research and clinical trials are necessary to refine treatment protocols and establish clear, evidence-based guidelines for using diet and exercise to support Long COVID recovery.

## Summary

This study provides strong biological evidence linking an overactive immune system to the energy production crisis seen in ME/CFS. It suggests that patients' immune systems are "primed" to overreact to microbial triggers, leading to chronic inflammation that disrupts metabolism and cellular function. The findings offer a clear explanation for post-exertional malaise, showing that exercise worsens mitochondrial dysfunction and creates a state of systemic stress. This research connects many previously observed abnormalities—such as immune dysregulation, gut problems, and metabolic issues—into a more unified model of the disease and identifies specific pathways that could be targeted for future treatments.

## What was researched?

This study performed a comprehensive "multi-omics" analysis, examining proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), and immune responses in the blood of ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. The researchers investigated the biological changes that occur both at baseline and 24 hours after a cardiopulmonary exercise test to better understand the mechanisms driving the core symptoms of the illness.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating illness often triggered by an infection, yet no single pathogen has been consistently identified. Researchers hypothesized that the illness may result from a generalized, abnormal host response to various microbial triggers. This study aimed to investigate this hypothesis by exploring the underlying immune and metabolic disturbances, particularly those provoked by exercise, which are central to post-exertional malaise (PEM).

## How was it researched?

This was a multi-omics laboratory study involving 56 ME/CFS patients and 52 healthy controls. Blood samples were collected before and 24 hours after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Researchers analyzed the plasma for thousands of proteins and metabolites and also performed *ex vivo* experiments, stimulating whole blood with various microbial components to measure the resulting cytokine (immune messenger) production.

## What has been found?

The study found that ME/CFS patients have an exaggerated innate immune response, producing higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines when their blood was exposed to microbial triggers. After exercise, patients showed evidence of worsened mitochondrial dysfunction, including an abnormal increase in plasma citrate, suggesting a blockage in energy production. Researchers also identified systemic inflammation, complement activation, increased oxidative stress, disrupted tryptophan metabolism (which can affect serotonin), and signs of gut dysbiosis, many of which correlated with symptom severity.

## Discussion

The authors propose that ME/CFS may involve a "vicious cycle" where mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation perpetuate each other. They note that their findings are consistent with a "trained immunity" model, where an initial infection leaves the innate immune system in a hypersensitive state, causing it to overreact to subsequent triggers. The study acknowledges its primary limitation is that it did not directly investigate muscle or neural tissue, but instead drew conclusions from comprehensive blood analyses.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS pathophysiology involves a combination of heightened innate immunity and profound metabolic disturbances that are exacerbated by exercise. These findings provide a biological framework for understanding symptoms like PEM and brain fog. The study suggests that the identified biomarkers may help in patient subtyping and points toward several potential therapeutic avenues for future clinical trials, including drugs like metformin 💊 and supplements such as carnitine.

## Summary

This research provides molecular evidence that the abnormal response to exercise in ME/CFS involves changes to how genes are regulated. By tracking DNA modifications before and after exercise, the study identified specific, dynamic shifts in gene activity related to the immune system, inflammation, and blood vessel function that occur during PEM. This confirms that PEM has a distinct biological basis, moving us closer to a potential objective test to diagnose the condition and monitor its severity. Understanding these specific pathways also opens up new avenues for developing targeted treatments.

## What was researched?

This study investigated how the DNA of ME/CFS patients is epigenetically modified during post-exertional malaise (PEM). Researchers used a two-day cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to induce PEM in five patients and tracked changes in their DNA methylation patterns at three time points: before exercise, 24 hours after the first exercise, and 48 hours after the start of the study.

## Why was it researched?

PEM is the hallmark symptom of ME/CFS, but the molecular processes that cause it are not well understood. Previous studies by the authors suggested that DNA methylation, a process that controls gene activity, is a sensitive indicator of biological changes during ME/CFS relapses. This study aimed to use a controlled exercise stressor to precisely map these epigenetic changes as PEM develops, hoping to find molecular signatures that could explain the symptom and potentially be used for diagnosis.

## How was it researched?

This was a longitudinal precision medicine study involving five female ME/CFS patients and two healthy female controls. All participants performed a maximal effort CPET on two consecutive days to induce PEM. Blood samples were collected before the first test (0h), 24 hours later (before the second test), and 48 hours after the start (24h after the second test). The researchers then used Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) to analyze and compare the DNA methylation patterns in immune cells from these samples over time.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients showed a deterioration in cardiopulmonary function on the second day of exercise, which was not seen in the healthy controls. The analysis identified 205 unique, ME/CFS-specific changes in DNA methylation that occurred in response to exercise, with 98% of these changes being exclusive to the patient group. These epigenetic alterations followed distinct patterns over the 48-hour period and were linked to genes involved in endothelial function, inflammation, and immune regulation.

## Discussion

The authors noted that despite the ME/CFS patients having similar clinical profiles, they showed considerable individual variation (heterogeneity) in both their physiological and epigenetic responses to the exercise. However, the overall dysfunctional pathways affected were similar across the patients. In stark contrast, the two healthy controls showed very similar, almost identical, epigenetic responses to each other, highlighting that the changes observed in the ME/CFS group were disease-specific.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that PEM is associated with dynamic and specific epigenetic changes in genes related to stress and immune functions. These findings reveal potential molecular signatures that could be significant for both diagnosis and understanding the mechanisms behind ME/CFS. The authors suggest future work should integrate these epigenetic findings with other molecular data (like RNA and protein levels) and investigate cell-free DNA in plasma as another source for potential biomarkers.

## Summary

This research provides objective evidence that pyridostigmine, a drug that helps nerve communication, can offer immediate, short-term improvement in both muscle weakness and orthostatic intolerance for ME/CFS patients. The findings suggest that a disruption in acetylcholine signaling may be a component of the disease, contributing to symptoms like muscle fatiguability and heart rate dysregulation. While this was a small, preliminary study, it provides a strong scientific basis for pursuing larger clinical trials to determine if pyridostigmine could become an effective treatment for these debilitating symptoms.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the immediate effect of a single, low dose of pyridostigmine on muscle strength and orthostatic tolerance in patients with post-infectious ME/CFS. Researchers measured changes in hand grip strength (HGS) and heart rate during a standing test after administering the drug.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is characterized by muscle weakness and fatiguability, and many patients also suffer from orthostatic intolerance like POTS. Pyridostigmine 💊, a drug known to increase the availability of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, has previously been shown to improve cardiac output in ME/CFS and is sometimes used off-label. This study aimed to objectively measure if it could also provide a rapid benefit for muscular and orthostatic symptoms.

## How was it researched?

This was a within-subject study involving 20 patients with post-infectious ME/CFS. On a baseline visit, their HGS was measured ten times and then repeated after one hour to assess strength recovery. On a second visit, the same procedure was followed, but patients received a single 30 mg dose of pyridostigmine after the first set of measurements. Orthostatic function was also assessed with a passive standing test with and without the drug, and patients were tested for myasthenia gravis autoantibodies to rule out that condition.

## What has been found?

Without the drug, patients' maximum hand grip strength significantly decreased by a median of 32% when re-tested after an hour, showing poor strength recovery. In contrast, one hour after taking pyridostigmine, their maximum hand grip strength significantly improved by a median of 2.6 kg. Pyridostigmine also improved orthostatic function, significantly reducing the increase in heart rate upon standing from a median of 17 bpm to 13 bpm. None of the patients tested positive for myasthenia gravis autoantibodies.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that pyridostigmine's positive effect on muscle strength could be due to increased acetylcholine availability at the neuromuscular junction, improving the signaling from nerves to muscles. The improvement in orthostatic function is likely due to the drug's known ability to enhance parasympathetic (the "rest and digest") nervous system activity. The study's main limitations were its small sample size and its non-controlled, non-randomized design.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that a single dose of pyridostigmine can rapidly and significantly improve both muscle strength and orthostatic function in ME/CFS patients. The authors state these promising findings warrant further investigation in larger, controlled clinical trials to properly assess the drug's potential as a treatment for key symptoms of ME/CFS.

## Summary

This large-scale study confirms that problems with the autonomic nervous system are nearly universal in ME/CFS patients and are not just a side issue, but are directly linked to how sick a person is. It shows that patients with more severe autonomic symptoms—like dizziness upon standing, gastrointestinal distress, and light sensitivity—also have worse fatigue, pain, sleep problems, and cognitive dysfunction. The research underscores the value of using multiple tools, including questionnaires and simple physical tests like the Lean Test, to identify autonomic issues. These findings strongly support making the assessment and management of dysautonomia a central part of clinical care for ME/CFS, as treating these issues may help reduce the overall severity of the illness.

## What was researched?

This study evaluated the prevalence and types of autonomic nervous system symptoms (dysautonomia) in a large group of ME/CFS patients from seven specialty clinics across the U.S. The researchers aimed to understand the relationship between these autonomic symptoms and the overall severity of the illness.

## Why was it researched?

Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, such as orthostatic intolerance (OI), are known to be common in ME/CFS and are part of its diagnostic criteria. However, previous studies had not directly examined how the burden of various autonomic symptoms relates to the severity of other ME/CFS symptoms like fatigue, pain, and functional impairment. This research sought to fill that knowledge gap using a large, multi-site patient cohort.

## How was it researched?

This was an analytical study using data collected between 2012 and 2020 from the Multi-Site Clinical Assessment of ME/CFS (MCAM). The cohort included 301 ME/CFS patients and 141 healthy controls. Autonomic dysfunction was assessed using three different methods: a patient questionnaire (Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale 31 or COMPASS-31), a review of participants' medical histories, and an objective physical test (NASA Lean Test for orthostatic intolerance). Illness severity was measured using several validated patient-reported outcome questionnaires.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients reported a significantly higher burden of autonomic symptoms compared to healthy controls, with 97% of patients having at least one such symptom. The study found a strong correlation between the presence of autonomic dysfunction and greater illness severity. Specifically, ME/CFS patients with symptoms in the orthostatic intolerance, gastrointestinal, and pupillomotor (related to light sensitivity) domains experienced more severe fatigue, pain, cognitive problems, sleep impairment, and reduced physical functioning.

## Discussion

The authors note that a key strength of the study is its large sample size, drawn from seven different specialty clinics. However, they acknowledge limitations, including that the study participants were predominantly White, educated, and had health insurance, which may not be representative of the entire ME/CFS population. Additionally, the reliance on some patient-reported measures is subjective, and the review of medical records was not standardized across clinics.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that people with ME/CFS have a substantial burden of autonomic dysfunction that is directly associated with greater overall illness severity and functional impairment. The findings highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing dysautonomia in ME/CFS care. The authors suggest that future studies should investigate whether individualized treatment strategies targeting autonomic symptoms can effectively improve quality of life for patients.

## Summary

This research provides a significant biological explanation for the persistent ME/CFS-like symptoms in Long COVID, linking their severity to sustained activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. It shows that the intensity of the initial infection, particularly the degree of oxygen deprivation, can trigger a long-lasting inflammatory state. Identifying the NLRP3 pathway as a key driver is crucial because it is a known "druggable target," meaning that existing or developing drugs could potentially be repurposed to treat Long COVID by calming this specific source of inflammation, offering a promising avenue for future therapeutic interventions.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether activation of a specific part of the innate immune system, known as the NLRP3 inflammasome, is linked to the persistent neuropsychiatric and chronic fatigue symptoms (termed the "physio-affective phenome") experienced by patients with Long COVID.

## Why was it researched?

Previous research established that the severity of Long COVID symptoms is predicted by the intensity of the acute COVID-19 infection, particularly by high fever and low oxygen saturation. This suggested that the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) plays a key role, but there was a lack of specific data confirming the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in the chronic phase of the illness.

## How was it researched?

This was a patient data analysis study involving 161 Long COVID patients, assessed 6 to 9 months after their acute infection. Patients were divided into two groups ("mild" vs. "severe") based on their peak body temperature and oxygen saturation levels during the initial illness. Researchers measured the serum levels of NLRP3 and related inflammatory biomarkers, including caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18, to determine the level of inflammasome activation during the Long COVID phase.

## What has been found?

The study found that patients who had experienced a more severe acute COVID-19 infection had significantly higher levels of NLRP3 and its associated inflammatory markers months later. These elevated biomarker levels were strongly correlated with the overall severity of Long COVID symptoms, including chronic fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, low oxygen saturation ($SpO_2$) during the acute infection was a significant predictor of increased NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the subsequent months.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge two main limitations. First, as a case-control study, it can demonstrate strong associations but cannot definitively prove a causal link between NLRP3 activation and Long COVID symptoms. Second, the study was conducted on a specific population in Iraq, and the findings need to be replicated in other countries to ensure generalizability.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is strongly associated with the severity of Long COVID. The findings suggest that targeting this pathway could be a beneficial therapeutic strategy for both the acute and chronic phases of COVID-19. They note that novel drugs are already in development to specifically inhibit NLRP3 activation, with several potential inhibitors like MCC950 💊, Dapansutrile 💊, Melatonin 💊, Colchicine 💊, and Baricitinib 💊 already in clinical trials.

## Summary

This research identifies a specific autoimmune reaction that may explain some of the most debilitating symptoms of Post-COVID Syndrome. It shows that people with PCS have higher levels of antibodies that attack their own nerve cells in the brainstem and mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of all cells. The presence of these autoantibodies was directly linked to worse physical function and more severe respiratory problems, providing a tangible biological basis for these symptoms. This discovery is a step towards developing an objective biomarker to identify a subset of patients and could open new avenues for treatments that target this specific autoimmune process, although further research is needed to confirm these findings.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether specific IgG autoantibodies that target neuronal (DAB1) and mitochondrial (AIFM1, SURF1) proteins in the brainstem are present in patients with Post COVID Syndrome (PCS). The researchers aimed to determine if these antibodies are associated with the clinical symptoms of PCS, such as reduced functional status, respiratory issues, fatigue, and cognitive problems.

## Why was it researched?

The same research group had previously identified these specific autoantibodies as markers of severe *acute* COVID-19. They hypothesized that a persistent, ongoing autoimmune response against these same neuronal and mitochondrial proteins might contribute to the long-term symptoms seen in PCS, particularly those affecting respiratory and functional capacity.

## How was it researched?

This was a patient data analysis study that measured IgG antibody levels in serum samples from 45 patients with PCS and 30 control individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 without long-term symptoms. Using a multiplexed bead-based immunoassay, they tested for antibodies against 18 synthetic peptides derived from the DAB1, AIFM1, and SURF1 proteins. The researchers then used advanced statistical models to analyze the relationship between antibody levels and a wide range of clinical data, including functional status (PCFS scale), fatigue, and cognitive scores (MoCA), collected at 3 and 6 months post-infection.

## What has been found?

Higher levels of autoantibodies against the three target proteins (DAB1, AIFM1, SURF1) were found to be a significant predictor of having PCS three months after infection. Statistical analysis revealed that these elevated antibody levels were specifically associated with a combination of more severe respiratory symptoms and a lower functional status (worse disability). Interestingly, no correlation was found between these autoantibody levels and cognitive performance as measured by the MoCA test.

## Discussion

The authors note that the study's findings are consistent with the known biological functions of the autoantigen targets, which are involved in brainstem respiratory control and mitochondrial energy production. They acknowledge several limitations, including the correlational nature of the study (it shows an association, not a cause), the relatively small sample size, and differences between the patient and control groups regarding sex and vaccination status. The lack of correlation with cognitive test scores may be due to the insensitivity of the MoCA tool in the PCS population.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that a sustained autoimmune response targeting specific neuronal and mitochondrial proteins is likely involved in PCS, contributing to respiratory dysfunction and reduced functional capacity. These autoantibodies could potentially serve as biomarkers for disability in PCS. The authors call for future research to replicate these findings in larger patient groups, establish a causal link, and explore these autoantibodies as potential targets for immunomodulatory therapies.

## Summary

This study provides preliminary evidence that a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, rTMS, can be safely adapted for ME/CFS patients and may help reduce a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances. The success of the modified protocol underscores the importance of designing flexible clinical trials that can accommodate the limitations imposed by the illness. The finding that baseline brainwave activity might predict who responds best is a promising step toward personalizing treatments and developing objective biomarkers for ME/CFS. While encouraging, these are early findings from a small study that require confirmation in larger, more rigorous controlled trials.

## What was researched?

This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, tolerability, and short-term effectiveness of a novel repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol for treating the primary symptoms of ME/CFS. The protocol involved stimulating two separate brain regions—the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the primary motor cortex (M1). The researchers also used electroencephalography (EEG) to see if baseline brainwave activity could predict treatment outcomes.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a complex illness with debilitating symptoms and no specific approved treatments. Since rTMS has shown effectiveness in treating similar symptoms (like pain, fatigue, and mood issues) in other conditions, the researchers hypothesized that a dual-target approach could have synergistic effects and benefit multiple ME/CFS symptom domains simultaneously. Previous rTMS studies in ME/CFS were limited, using only a single target or a short course of treatment, so this study aimed to test a more comprehensive protocol.

## How was it researched?

This was an open-label pilot study involving 15 female participants diagnosed with ME/CFS. After the first five participants dropped out due to poor tolerability of the initial protocol, the researchers implemented a modified, more flexible protocol for the remaining 10 participants. This modified protocol included 30 sessions of dual-target rTMS with adjustments for stimulation intensity and a less demanding schedule (e.g., multiple sessions in one day to reduce travel). Symptom improvement was measured across five domains (fatigue, pain, mood, sleep, and cognition) from baseline to the end of treatment.

## What has been found?

The modified rTMS protocol was found to be safe and well-tolerated, with all 10 participants completing the full 30 sessions. Participants showed, on average, some improvement in all five symptom domains. 70% of the completers were classified as "overall responders," defined as showing meaningful improvement in at least two of the five symptom areas. The study also found that baseline EEG patterns were associated with outcomes; specifically, lower levels of slow-wave (delta and theta) activity and higher levels of alpha activity were linked to better improvement in fatigue and sleep.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that the study highlights the necessity of adapting clinical trial protocols to the specific needs of the ME/CFS population, as their initial rigid design was not feasible. They acknowledge several limitations, including the open-label design (which can increase placebo effects), the small sample size, and the lack of long-term follow-up to assess the durability of the clinical benefits. The heterogeneity of patient responses suggests that future research should focus on personalizing treatment based on individual symptom profiles.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that dual-target rTMS is a potentially safe, tolerable, and promising treatment for the primary symptoms of ME/CFS. The positive results support conducting larger, randomized, and sham-controlled studies to definitively establish the efficacy of this novel treatment approach. Future research should also aim to replicate the EEG findings, which could serve as a biomarker to predict treatment response and guide clinical decisions.

## Summary

This review consolidates the earliest clinical evidence for using Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) to treat long covid, finding that in small, uncontrolled studies, patients reported significant improvements in fatigue, pain, brain fog, sleep, and daily function. While these initial results are promising, the lack of placebo-controlled trials means we cannot yet be certain that LDN is responsible for these benefits. The study highlights LDN as an important candidate for future treatment, underscoring the urgent need for the larger, more rigorous randomized trials that are already in progress to provide definitive answers.

## What was researched?

This systematic review aimed to evaluate all available evidence on the effectiveness of low dose naltrexone (LDN) for alleviating the symptoms of long covid, such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and pain.

## Why was it researched?

Long covid is a debilitating chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, creating an urgent need for effective treatments. Due to the significant symptom overlap between long covid and ME/CFS, and shared biological abnormalities, researchers hypothesized that low dose naltrexone 💊, an off-label medication sometimes used for ME/CFS and other neuroimmune disorders, might also be beneficial for long covid patients.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic review where researchers searched medical databases and trial registries for all studies on LDN for long covid published up to May 1, 2025. They intended to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pre-post studies. After screening 226 records, they found no RCTs and based their analysis on four observational pre-post studies from the USA and Ireland, which included a total of 155 patients. The data from these studies were pooled for a meta-analysis to calculate the overall effect on various symptoms.

## What has been found?

The review found no randomized controlled trials. However, the pooled analysis of four small pre-post studies showed that LDN was associated with moderate improvements in fatigue, brain fog, and sleep quality. It showed large improvements in pain and daily functioning. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies that assessed safety.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that the primary limitation is the low certainty of the evidence because all included studies lacked a control or placebo group. This makes it impossible to determine if the observed improvements were caused by LDN or by other factors like the natural course of the illness, regression to the mean, or a placebo effect. They also note that the use of different outcome measures across studies and the potential for publication bias are further limitations.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that while preliminary observational evidence suggests LDN may improve key long covid symptoms, the evidence is of low certainty. They state that well-powered, randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings, establish efficacy, determine optimal dosing and duration, and confirm safety. The review notes that three such trials are currently underway.

## Summary

This research identifies a potential new way to measure a specific type of stress on the kidneys in ME/CFS patients using the protein SMPDL3B, even when standard kidney tests appear normal. This provides a biological basis for subtle kidney involvement in the disease and connects it to the systemic metabolic and mitochondrial problems frequently reported. The finding that patients can be sorted into three distinct groups based on their SMPDL3B levels is a significant step towards personalized medicine, potentially explaining why the illness presents differently among individuals. This work offers a promising, non-invasive biomarker that could help in diagnosing, subgrouping, and monitoring ME/CFS in the future.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether levels of a protein, Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase Acid-Like 3B (SMPDL3B), in the plasma and urine could serve as a biomarker for subtle, subclinical kidney alterations in people with ME/CFS. Researchers also explored the connection between SMPDL3B, renal function, and broader metabolic profiles to better understand the disease's mechanisms.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a poorly understood multisystem illness lacking objective diagnostic tests. Previous research has pointed to metabolic disturbances and potential organ-specific issues, including mild kidney involvement. Since SMPDL3B is crucial for the function of podocytes (specialized kidney cells) and has been previously linked to ME/CFS severity, the authors hypothesized that dysregulation of this protein could connect systemic metabolic problems with renal stress in the disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a cross-sectional study that analyzed plasma and urine samples from 56 ME/CFS patients and 16 matched healthy controls. The researchers measured SMPDL3B levels, estimated renal clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and performed comprehensive metabolomic profiling of plasma. The findings were analyzed to identify differences between groups, correlations between biomarkers and clinical data, and to explore sex-specific patterns.

## What has been found?

ME/CFS patients had significantly lower urine-to-plasma ratios of soluble SMPDL3B and reduced renal clearance compared to controls, suggesting early-stage kidney impairment even with normal plasma creatinine levels. This ratio was found to be an independent predictor of kidney clearance. The study also identified significant alterations in plasma metabolites related to renal function and mitochondrial energy production, such as decreased succinic acid and 1,5-anhydrosorbitol. Furthermore, female ME/CFS patients exhibited more pronounced alterations in SMPDL3B levels, lower kidney clearance, and greater symptom severity than male patients. Patient stratification based on plasma SMPDL3B levels revealed three distinct subgroups with unique renal, metabolic, and lipid profiles.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the study's integrative approach as a major strength, combining biomarker analysis with renal function and metabolomics. Key limitations acknowledged include the cross-sectional design, which prevents determining causality, and the relatively small sample size, which may limit the statistical power of subgroup analyses. The lack of direct tissue validation (e.g., via kidney biopsy) is also noted, suggesting that future studies could provide deeper mechanistic insights.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that altered SMPDL3B dynamics are associated with subclinical renal dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities in ME/CFS. The urine-to-plasma SMPDL3B ratio emerges as a promising, non-invasive biomarker for detecting early renal stress in this population. The authors suggest that these findings underscore the heterogeneity of ME/CFS and support the need for larger, longitudinal studies to validate these biomarkers and develop more personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Summary

This study provides preliminary evidence that solriamfetol, a drug already approved for conditions like narcolepsy, may also be effective in reducing the severity of fatigue and improving certain cognitive difficulties in ME/CFS. Its mechanism of action, targeting both norepinephrine and dopamine, offers a different pathway for symptom management than many previously studied drugs. While these results are promising, this was a small, short-term trial, and the findings must be replicated in larger studies before solriamfetol can be considered a proven treatment option for the ME/CFS community.

## What was researched?

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol 💊, a medication approved for promoting wakefulness in sleep disorders, for treating fatigue and cognitive symptoms in adults with ME/CFS over an 8-week period. The primary goal was to measure changes in fatigue, with a secondary look at executive function.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating long-term illness with no approved treatments that address the disease directly. Based on the theory that dual norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors might be effective for fatigue, researchers wanted to test solriamfetol, which works through this mechanism, to see if it could alleviate key symptoms of ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This was a phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 38 adults who met the 2015 IOM diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either solriamfetol (75 mg, titrated up to 150 mg) or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. Fatigue severity was measured using the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and executive function was assessed with the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults (BRIEF-A).

## What has been found?

After 8 weeks of treatment, the group receiving solriamfetol showed a statistically significant improvement in fatigue severity compared to the placebo group. The medication also led to significant improvements in overall executive function, driven specifically by gains in metacognition (e.g., planning, organization, memory). The drug was well-tolerated, with the most common side effects reported by the treatment group being sleep loss and anxiety.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, primarily the study's small sample size and limited geographical reach, which means the results require confirmation in a larger, more diverse clinical trial. They noted that while fatigue *severity* improved, the *interference* of fatigue in daily life did not significantly change, suggesting a longer treatment period might be needed to see such effects. Additionally, the use of some telehealth visits could have influenced responses, and the rapid dose titration limited the ability to analyze dose-specific effects.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that solriamfetol demonstrated good safety and was effective at improving both fatigue severity and specific aspects of executive function in adults with ME/CFS. This suggests that its wakefulness-promoting properties have the potential to benefit patients with this disease. Future research should involve larger, more diverse populations to validate these findings and to investigate optimal dosing strategies.

## Summary

This review consolidates scientific evidence showing that ME/CFS, Long COVID, Fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Illness are not entirely separate, but share fundamental biological problems related to cellular energy production (mitochondrial dysfunction), chronic inflammation, and immune system irregularities. By grouping them as "low-energy disorders," the paper reinforces their biological basis and suggests that treatments targeting these core issues could be broadly effective. The authors highlight coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) 💊 as a promising intervention, as it directly supports cellular energy production and fights oxidative stress, with some existing studies showing it can reduce key symptoms like fatigue and pain. This provides a scientific rationale for exploring CoQ10 further and encourages a more unified research approach to finding treatments for this cluster of debilitating conditions.

## What was researched?

This paper reviewed the scientific evidence for overlapping symptoms and shared biological mechanisms across four distinct conditions: Gulf War Illness (GWI), Fibromyalgia (FM), Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), and Long COVID. The authors investigated the common pathologies to establish a rationale for potential therapeutic strategies, particularly focusing on the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation and stem cell therapy.

## Why was it researched?

These chronic, disabling disorders affect millions of people worldwide but remain poorly understood, lack objective diagnostic biomarkers, and have few effective, approved treatments. By identifying the shared biological underpinnings, researchers hope to illuminate the disease processes and pave the way for developing targeted therapies that could potentially benefit patients across all four conditions, addressing a significant unmet medical need.

## How was it researched?

This study was a literature review. The authors analyzed and synthesized findings from a wide range of existing research papers to compare and contrast the clinical symptoms and known biological abnormalities in GWI, FM, ME/CFS, and Long COVID. They specifically searched for common pathways related to cellular energy, immunity, and inflammation, and also reviewed clinical studies on potential treatments that target these pathways.

## What has been found?

The review confirmed that these four disorders share a core set of symptoms, including debilitating fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), cognitive dysfunction ("brain fog"), widespread pain, and sleep disturbances. Furthermore, it identified several common underlying biological mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysregulation, a disrupted gut-brain axis, and accelerated cellular aging (telomere shortening). The paper presents a strong rationale for the therapeutic use of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) 💊, which has been shown in some studies to improve fatigue and pain by addressing several of these shared pathologies, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the extensive overlap in both symptoms and biology raises the question of why these conditions are classified as four separate disorders. They point out that the lack of specific biomarkers and objective diagnostic criteria complicates research and clinical care, leading to difficulties in diagnosis and the development of effective treatments. The authors state that this is the first review to summarize these specific shared mechanisms across all four illnesses and connect them to the therapeutic potential of CoQ10 and stem cell therapy.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that GWI, FM, ME/CFS, and Long COVID can be collectively understood as a group of "low-energy associated disorders" with shared pathophysiological features. They propose that supplementary CoQ10 is a rational therapeutic approach for managing these conditions due to its role in improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. The paper calls for large-scale, rigorous randomized controlled trials to fully understand the benefits of CoQ10 and to establish effective dosing protocols for these complex illnesses.

## Summary

This research provides valuable long-term insight, showing that over three years, many Long COVID patients experience a gradual clinical improvement. The study's brain imaging results are particularly noteworthy: while some structural changes persist, the brain appears to be actively compensating, with some areas stabilizing and improving their connections (like the brainstem) while others work harder (like the basal ganglia). Crucially, the absence of elevated blood markers for neuronal damage or inflammation suggests that these brain changes are part of a recovery and reorganization process, rather than a progressive degenerative disease. This points to the brain's remarkable capacity for healing over the long term, even after a significant viral insult.

## What was researched?

This longitudinal study tracked the clinical symptoms, brain structure and function, and blood biomarkers of patients with Post-COVID-19 Condition (PCC) over a three-year period. The primary objective was to identify potential signs of brain recovery and understand the underlying factors associated with long-term changes after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Why was it researched?

Previous studies have documented persistent fatigue, cognitive issues, and brain changes for up to two years after COVID-19. However, longer-term data was lacking, and most research had not integrated neuroimaging with analysis of inflammatory and neuronal injury markers. This study aimed to fill that gap by extending the observation period to three years to better understand the evolution of the condition and the trajectory of brain recovery.

## How was it researched?

This was a single-center, longitudinal observational study involving 51 patients with PCC and 23 healthy controls. Data was collected at three time points: approximately 6, 23, and 38 months after the initial infection. The methodology included structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess brain volume and activity, comprehensive neuropsychological testing for cognitive function, clinical questionnaires for symptoms like fatigue, and blood tests for markers of inflammation (interleukins) and neuronal injury (NfL, GFAP).

## What has been found?

Three years post-infection, patients showed slow but evident clinical improvement, with self-reported fatigue improving but still remaining moderate on average. Cognitive performance and muscle strength were largely normal. Brain imaging revealed an increase in the size of the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) and a corresponding volume reduction in adjacent structures like the thalamus and basal ganglia. However, these same regions showed increased neuronal activation, while the brainstem, which had previously shown volume loss, stabilized and exhibited enhanced functional connectivity. Importantly, blood markers for neuronal injury and inflammation remained within normal ranges throughout the study.

## Discussion

The authors note that the observed volume loss in certain brain regions is not accompanied by biomarkers of neurodegeneration, suggesting it may be due to cellular shrinking rather than nerve cell death. They interpret the combination of structural changes with increased neuronal activation and connectivity as a sign of brain compensation and recovery. A key limitation is the absence of a control group that had asymptomatic COVID-19, as the study used pre-pandemic healthy control data for comparison.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that patients with PCC demonstrate a slow but positive long-term recovery trajectory. This recovery is reflected in the brain through a pattern of structural stabilization (starting in the brainstem) and efficient neuronal compensation in other affected regions, all without evidence of ongoing systemic inflammation or neurodegeneration. The findings underscore a complex but ultimately hopeful path of recovery for many patients.

- **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2025.1691147)
- **What was researched?**
This randomized, controlled trial investigated the effects of the metabolic compound oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 on self-reported fatigue, objective cognitive function, and time spent in upright activity (UP Time) in patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). The study's primary aim was to understand the interrelationships between these three key symptoms and how they respond to treatment.
- **Why was it researched?**
ME/CFS is a complex disease marked by fatigue, cognitive impairment, and physical dysfunction, but the connections between these core symptoms and their responsiveness to treatment are not well understood. Oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 had previously shown potential for reducing fatigue symptoms in ME/CFS, prompting this study to explore its impact across multiple, essential domains of the illness, particularly its potential mitochondrial and neuroprotective effects.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a 90-day, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial involving 82 adults with ME/CFS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2,000 mg/day of Oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 or a control of 2,000 mg of rice flour. Fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire), cognitive function (DANA Brain Vital), and UP Time were assessed at baseline and three follow-up visits. The data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models to determine the associations and treatment effects.
- **What has been found?**
The OAA 💊 group showed significantly greater improvement in cognitive function compared to the control group at the 60-day mark (Visit 3, $p = 0.034$). Higher fatigue was strongly associated with reduced cognitive gains only in the OAA-treated group ($\beta = –0.34, p < 0.0001$). UP Time showed a small increase in the OAA group, reaching significance at the 30-day mark ($p = 0.044$), but fatigue was not a strong predictor of this change.
- **Discussion:**
The authors highlight that the strong connection, or "coupling," between fatigue and cognition observed specifically in the OAA 💊 group suggests that OAA may be targeting a mechanism that links these two symptoms. They note that while differences in "responder status" (patients meeting specific improvement criteria) between the groups did not reach statistical significance, the trends support a benefit of OAA. The findings underscore the critical need to use multiple, multidimensional outcome measures (like fatigue, cognition, and physical activity) in ME/CFS clinical trials.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The study concludes that OAA 💊 supplementation was associated with improved cognitive performance and a small increase in upright activity time in the ME/CFS participants. The strong fatigue–cognition coupling found in OAA-treated participants suggests a potentially targetable sub-phenotype of the illness. The authors recommend conducting more research and trials focused on metabolic interventions like OAA 💊 in ME/CFS.
- **Summary:**
This research provides evidence that Oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 may selectively improve cognitive function and modestly increase time spent upright in a subset of ME/CFS patients. The finding that high fatigue dampened cognitive gains specifically in the OAA 💊 group, known as "fatigue–cognition coupling," is a significant novel observation that suggests OAA's action may be tied to a specific biological pathway linking these two core symptoms. Although OAA's effect was not universally significant across all measures, this study supports the exploration of metabolic approaches for ME/CFS treatment and reinforces the necessity of using comprehensive measures—beyond just fatigue—to assess the true impact of potential therapies.
- **Simple Summary:**
A trial found that taking the supplement Oxaloacetate (OAA) 💊 was linked to better thinking abilities and a slight increase in standing time for people with ME/CFS. Researchers also discovered a strong connection between how tired a person felt and how much their thinking improved when taking the supplement. This work suggests that supplements focusing on the body's energy pathways are a promising area for future treatment research.

## Summary

This paper provides a strong theoretical framework that shifts the focus from the nervous system to the muscle cells themselves to explain severe muscle symptoms in ME/CFS. It suggests that a fundamental cellular machine—the sodium-potassium pump—is failing, creating a vicious cycle of electrical instability, energy depletion, and mitochondrial damage within the muscles. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it could provide a concrete biological basis for symptoms like muscle weakness and twitching, and importantly, identify the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase as a potential new and highly specific target for future drug development.

## What was researched?

This paper presents a hypothesis to explain the causes of severe muscle weakness (myasthenia), twitching (fasciculations), and cramps in severely ill, bedridden ME/CFS patients. The central theory focuses on the role of a dysfunctional cellular pump, the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, and the resulting disturbances in the electrical properties of skeletal muscle cells.

## Why was it researched?

While severe muscle symptoms are a major cause of disability in ME/CFS, standard neurological investigations typically fail to find a neuronal cause. This has created a knowledge gap. The authors aimed to propose a unifying theory rooted in muscle cell pathophysiology to explain a range of symptoms, including loss of force, fatigue, and fasciculations, from a single underlying mechanism.

## How was it researched?

This is a hypothesis paper and literature review, not an experimental study. The authors synthesized findings from existing research—including their own previous work on ME/CFS—to build a theoretical model. They connect concepts related to ion transport, cellular electrophysiology, mitochondrial dysfunction, and clinical symptoms to form a cohesive argument for their proposed pathomechanism.

## What has been found?

The authors propose that insufficient activity of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump is the core problem. This dysfunction is theorized to cause a cascade of events: 1) It leads to depolarization of the muscle cell membrane, making it hyperexcitable (causing fasciculations) while also impairing effective muscle contraction (causing weakness). 2) This leads to an overload of sodium and then calcium inside the muscle cell, which in turn damages mitochondria. 3) The damaged mitochondria produce less energy (ATP) and more reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further impairs the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, creating a self-reinforcing vicious cycle where "depolarization causes further depolarization."

## Discussion

The authors argue that this single, core dysfunction of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase can logically explain the diverse and severe skeletal muscle symptoms observed in the most ill ME/CFS patients. They suggest that this central issue is likely driven by multiple upstream factors known to be present in ME/CFS, such as autoantibodies, mitochondrial dysfunction, lack of hormonal stimulation, and inhibition by reactive oxygen species. The paper posits that severely ill patients are essentially trapped in a state of chronic muscle cell depolarization and mitochondrial damage.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that insufficient Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity provides a plausible, unifying explanation for the combination of muscle weakness, fatigue, and fasciculations in severe ME/CFS. This model suggests that even in moderately ill patients, periods of post-exertional malaise (PEM) could represent a transient state of muscle cell depolarization. Future work would need to validate this hypothesis, likely requiring advanced techniques on muscle biopsies from severely ill patients to directly measure these electrophysiological and ionic disturbances.

## Summary

This study adds to the growing body of evidence showing a distinct gut microbiome signature in ME/CFS, characterized by reduced diversity and a depletion of key anti-inflammatory bacteria like *Roseburia* and *Ruminococcus*. This finding supports the hypothesis that impaired gut health and reduced production of beneficial compounds like butyrate may contribute to systemic inflammation and other symptoms. The high accuracy of the machine learning model in distinguishing patients from controls based on their gut bacteria is a promising step towards developing a non-invasive, biomarker-based diagnostic tool. Critically, the research establishes a direct link between the composition of the gut microbiome and objective measures of cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that future treatments aimed at restoring gut health could be a viable strategy for alleviating the "brain fog" experienced by patients.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to compare the gut microbial composition of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) to that of healthy controls (HCs).  Researchers also investigated the relationship between the gut bacteria and the severity of cognitive dysfunction, or 'brain fog', a key symptom of the illness.

## Why was it researched?

The underlying cause of ME/CFS remains unknown, but gastrointestinal problems are frequently reported by patients.  It is hypothesized that gut dysbiosis—an imbalance in gut bacteria—could be a contributing factor, potentially disrupting the gut-brain axis and leading to neurological symptoms.  Previous studies in this area were limited and their findings were difficult to compare, necessitating further research to clarify the role of the microbiome in ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This was a comparative laboratory study that analyzed fecal samples from 25 CFS patients and 16 healthy controls.  The researchers used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the types and abundance of bacteria in each group's gut microbiome.  They then compared the diversity of bacteria within and between the groups and used machine learning models to determine if the microbiome data could accurately classify individuals as having CFS or being healthy.  Cognitive function was objectively assessed using a validated neuropsychological task, the Trail Making Test (TMT).

## What has been found?

There were significant differences in the gut microbial composition between CFS patients and healthy controls.  CFS patients showed lower microbial richness, meaning they had fewer types of bacteria overall.  Three specific bacterial variants, including the butyrate-producing genera *Roseburia* and *Ruminococcus*, were found in significantly higher abundance in the healthy control group.  Furthermore, a machine learning model (Neural Network) was able to distinguish between CFS patients and healthy controls based on their microbiome data with excellent accuracy (AUC=0.935).  The study also found a significant relationship between gut microbial composition and performance on cognitive tests in both groups.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the small sample size and the exclusion of patients with severe or very severe symptoms.  The use of the older Fukuda diagnostic criteria, which does not mandate post-exertional malaise (PEM), was also noted as a limiting factor.  Potential confounding factors such as diet, medication, and antibiotic/probiotic use were not controlled for, and the machine learning model may have a risk of overfitting, which could limit its generalizability to other patient groups.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the gut microbial composition in CFS patients is distinctly different from that of healthy controls.  They recommend that future studies should investigate the functional consequences of these microbial differences and explore the effectiveness of therapies designed to modify the gut microbiome.  Subsequent research should involve larger patient cohorts, use more recent diagnostic criteria that require PEM, and employ more advanced analytical methods to better understand the complex interactions within the gut ecosystem.

## Summary

This editorial is significant for the ME/CFS community because it officially categorizes the illness alongside other major neurological and inflammatory disorders in a high-level medical journal. By framing ME/CFS and Long COVID as essential models for understanding oxidative stress, the authors help move the condition into the scientific mainstream, which can lead to increased research funding and awareness. The focus on shared "vicious circles" of inflammation provides a biological explanation for why symptoms can be so persistent and debilitating. While many of the discussed therapies are still in the experimental stage, the recognition of these specific biological drivers is a critical step toward moving away from symptom management and toward addressing the actual cause of the illness.

## What was researched?

This editorial explores the complex biological pathways—or pathomechanisms—that drive various central nervous system (CNS) disorders, with a specific focus on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. It synthesizes recent research to highlight shared biological characteristics between conditions like Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Long COVID, and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

## Why was it researched?

CNS disorders are notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat because they involve multiple organ systems and intricate cellular interactions that are not yet fully understood. The authors argue that identifying common drivers, such as immune system dysfunction and metabolic stress, is a mandatory prerequisite for developing the next generation of targeted and personalized medical treatments.

## How was it researched?

This paper is a high-level scientific editorial and literature review that introduces a specialized issue of the journal *Neuroprotection*. The authors analyzed and integrated findings from multiple studies, including a conceptual framework comparing ME/CFS and Long COVID, systematic reviews on the role of astrocytes in brain inflammation, and research into blood-brain barrier permeability. They specifically looked at how emerging concepts, such as mitochondrial transfer and exosome therapy, might offer new ways to treat these complex illnesses.

## What has been found?

The researchers highlighted that ME/CFS and Long COVID share strikingly similar clinical profiles, with excessive oxidative stress acting as a central driver of the disease in both conditions. They found that neuroinflammation is not just a side effect but a major contributor to these illnesses, often involving a "vicious circle" where brain cells called astrocytes remain in a permanent inflammatory state. Additionally, the editorial notes that immunomodulatory approaches, such as low-dose IL-2 💊 and certain antidepressant medications 💊, are showing potential in clinical research for their ability to regulate the immune-inflammatory balance in patients with related neurological symptoms.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that while the link between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation is a strong lead, research into the specific pathomechanisms of ME/CFS is still in its infancy. They note that many current hypotheses require further confirmation and that the diversity of symptoms among patients makes it challenging to create a "one-size-fits-all" diagnostic test. They also highlight the potential of using ME/CFS and Long COVID as models to understand more traditional neurodegenerative diseases.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The editorial concludes that a deeper understanding of cellular communication and metabolic stress will be the foundation for future diagnostic breakthroughs. The authors suggest that subsequent research should focus on the role of exosomes and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier to identify more precise therapeutic targets. They advocate for a shift toward "precision medicine," where treatments are tailored to the specific inflammatory markers found in an individual patient.

## Summary

This study reveals that a specific inflammatory protein, PTX-3, can remain abnormally high for up to 10 months after a severe COVID-19 infection, long after other markers of acute illness have normalized. This suggests that the body may still be dealing with the after-effects of the virus, such as repairing damaged tissue. The research also found a genetic link, indicating that some individuals may be predisposed to both a more severe illness and this prolonged inflammatory signal. For patients with post-viral conditions, this identifies a potential objective biomarker (PTX-3) that reflects the long-lasting impact of a viral infection on the innate immune system.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the long-term plasma levels of five acute-phase proteins (CRP, MBL, PTX-3, SAA, and SP-D) in patients who had recovered from COVID-19. The researchers aimed to determine if these markers remained elevated months after infection, how their levels related to the initial disease severity, and whether genetic factors could explain any persistent changes.

## Why was it researched?

During an acute COVID-19 infection, high levels of these proteins are associated with severe disease, but they are expected to return to normal within days of recovery. It was unclear if COVID-19 could have a lasting impact on these innate immune factors. This research was motivated by the need to understand the long-term immunological consequences of the infection, particularly in patients who experienced severe illness.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study involving 141 COVID-19 convalescent patients (105 with mild and 36 with severe disease) and 98 non-infected controls. Researchers measured the plasma levels of the five proteins at 10 weeks and again at 10 months post-infection. In a subgroup of 36 severe and 38 mild patients, they performed genetic sequencing of the PTX-3 gene to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used statistical modeling to connect genetics, protein levels, and disease severity.

## What has been found?

At 10 weeks post-infection, only pentraxin 3 (PTX-3) levels were significantly higher in convalescent patients compared to controls, an effect driven primarily by the severe COVID-19 group. While PTX-3 levels generally decreased by 10 months, a significantly higher percentage of severe patients still maintained very high levels. The study identified a strong association between a specific genetic variation (the homozygous wildtype A/A genotype at SNP rs971145291) and severe disease, and this relationship was shown to be mediated by its effect on raising PTX-3 levels.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the assessment at only two time points, the loss of some severe cases to follow-up, and the lack of genetic sequencing for the control group. They also note that the study was conducted early in the pandemic, so the findings may not apply to newer variants or vaccinated individuals. The prolonged elevation of PTX-3 is theorized to result from a combination of genetic predisposition and ongoing biological processes, such as tissue repair after severe lung damage.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that PTX-3 can serve as a long-term, retrospective biomarker for severe COVID-19, with its prolonged elevation being partly determined by a person's genetic makeup. They suggest PTX-3 may be a marker for sustained immune activation or tissue damage. Future studies are needed to explore its potential role in Long COVID and to validate the genetic findings in larger, more diverse cohorts.

## Summary

This study provides important evidence that a dedicated inpatient care model can lead to meaningful clinical improvement for some of the most severely ill ME/CFS patients. The findings suggest that providing a safe, low-stress environment where PEM is carefully managed is a powerful intervention in itself. The fact that patients with a shorter disease duration were more likely to improve underscores the potential importance of early diagnosis and supportive care. While the unit offered an optional supportive therapy program with various supplements and low-dose medications, their specific contribution to the positive outcomes remains unknown and requires further research.

## What was researched?

This study reports on the clinical outcomes from the first three years of a new, specialised inpatient care unit in Norway designed specifically for severely and very severely ill ME/CFS patients. The primary goal was to evaluate whether this dedicated care model led to any improvements in patient health.

## Why was it researched?

Prior to this initiative, no adapted care services existed in Norway for the most severely affected ME/CFS patients. The Norwegian ME Association and Røysumtunet, a private institution, collaborated to establish a unit that could provide a safe, respectful, and low-stimulation environment for this vulnerable population, aiming to offer proper care and recognition for their disease.

## How was it researched?

This was a retrospective review of medical records from the Røysumtunet ME unit. The study included 24 patients (20 women, 4 men) diagnosed with severe or very severe ME/CFS who stayed at the facility for at least three months between June 2021 and June 2024. The main outcome was the change in disease severity, as assessed by the attending physician according to the UK NICE guidelines. As part of the care model, patients were also offered an optional, four-step supportive therapy program that included high-dose thiamine 💊, NADH 💊, Coenzyme Q10 💊, vitamin B12 💊, low-dose naltrexone 💊, and low-dose aripiprazole 💊, although the specific effects of this program were not analyzed in this study.

## What has been found?

A total of 50% (12 out of 24) of the patients showed improvement during their stay. Seven patients (29.2%) experienced a "significant improvement" by moving up one or two levels on the NICE severity scale (e.g., from very severe to severe). An additional five patients (20.8%) showed "some improvement" within their severity level, such as better tolerance for sensory inputs or increased ability to perform small daily tasks. Improvement was significantly correlated with a shorter duration of illness (a mean of 2.3 years for improvers vs. 6.7 years for non-improvers).

## Discussion

The authors found the results encouraging, especially since the unit's primary purpose was care, not curative therapy. They hypothesize that the observed improvements stemmed from being in a safe, secure environment with individualized care that minimized Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) and reduced daily stress. The study's limitations include a small sample size, the difficulty of collecting systematic data from extremely ill patients, and the inability to draw conclusions about the effects of the supplemental therapies that some patients used.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a specialized care environment offering respect, understanding, and a focus on minimizing PEM can be beneficial for severely and very severely affected ME/CFS patients. They highlight a significant need for more such facilities in Norway and elsewhere. Future work should include systematic, international studies to investigate the specific factors contributing to improvement and to formally test potential therapeutic interventions.

## Summary

This study identifies a specific molecular abnormality in the brains of people with Long COVID "brain fog": a widespread increase in excitatory AMPA receptors. This finding provides a potential biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, suggesting that excessive excitatory signaling could be disrupting normal brain function. The research is significant because it moves beyond general observations of brain inflammation and offers a precise, measurable biomarker that can distinguish patients from healthy controls with high accuracy. Most importantly, by identifying a specific molecular target, it opens a direct and tangible path toward testing targeted treatments, such as drugs that block AMPA receptors, to potentially alleviate cognitive symptoms.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the density of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), which are crucial for excitatory brain signaling, in patients with cognitive impairment from Long COVID (Cog-LC). The researchers aimed to compare AMPAR levels between Cog-LC patients and healthy controls and to determine if these measurements could serve as an objective diagnostic tool.

## Why was it researched?

The neurological mechanisms behind the cognitive impairment or "brain fog" seen in Long COVID are poorly understood. While previous imaging studies have shown structural or metabolic brain changes, they haven't identified specific molecular targets. Since synapses are fundamental to brain function, the researchers hypothesized that investigating AMPARs, key molecules in learning and memory, could reveal the underlying pathology of Cog-LC.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. The researchers analyzed brain scans from 30 patients diagnosed with Cog-LC and compared them to existing scans from 80 healthy controls. They used a specific PET tracer, $[^{11}C]K-2$, which binds to AMPA receptors on the surface of neurons, to measure and compare receptor density. The team also measured plasma levels of inflammatory molecules (cytokines and chemokines) and used a machine learning algorithm to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the PET data.

## What has been found?

The study found a significant and widespread increase in AMPAR density across large parts of the brain in patients with Cog-LC compared to healthy controls. Higher AMPAR density was correlated with poorer performance on cognitive tests. The researchers also found that AMPAR density was positively correlated with the inflammatory marker TNFSF12 and negatively with the chemokine CCL2 in the blood. A machine learning model trained on the PET scan data was able to distinguish Cog-LC patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91.2% specificity.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the systemic increase in AMPARs could be driven by sustained neuroinflammation, a known feature of Long COVID, potentially disrupting the brain's normal signal processing and leading to cognitive deficits. Key limitations of the study include that the findings are correlational, not necessarily causal, and the patient cohort was restricted to Asians living in Japan, which may limit generalizability. The study did not directly measure inhibitory receptors, so the full impact on the brain's excitation/inhibition balance is unknown.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that increased brain-wide AMPAR density is a key pathological feature of cognitive Long COVID. They propose that AMPAR PET imaging with $[^{11}C]K-2$ is a promising tool for developing an objective diagnostic framework for the condition. The findings also suggest that AMPAR antagonists, such as the existing epilepsy drug perampanel 💊, could be a potential therapeutic strategy. The authors call for larger clinical studies to validate these findings and test this therapeutic hypothesis.

## Summary

This research introduces a new blood test that can diagnose severe ME/CFS with very high accuracy by identifying a unique epigenetic signature in the 3D structure of DNA. The findings provide strong biological evidence of ME/CFS as a disease rooted in immune and inflammatory dysregulation. Importantly, the test was able to separate patients into distinct biological subgroups based on these immune markers, which could be a critical step toward developing personalized treatments. Because the underlying EpiSwitch® technology is already used in approved clinical tests for other diseases, this ME/CFS test has a clearer and potentially faster path to becoming a widely available diagnostic tool.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to develop and validate a blood test for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Researchers used a technology called EpiSwitch® to screen for unique 3D structures in DNA, known as chromosome conformations (CCs), that could serve as definitive diagnostic biomarkers for the disease.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating disorder that currently lacks any objective diagnostic biomarkers, which complicates and often delays diagnosis. The researchers aimed to address this critical need by applying their novel epigenetic profiling technology, which has previously been successful in identifying biomarkers for other complex diseases like cancer and ALS.

## How was it researched?

This was a retrospective case-control study that analyzed whole blood samples from 47 patients with severe (housebound) ME/CFS and 61 healthy, age-matched controls. Using a whole-genome microarray, the researchers screened for nearly one million different chromosome conformations. They then used a machine learning algorithm to identify the top 200 markers that could distinguish between patients and controls, creating a predictive model that was then tested on a separate, independent group of samples to validate its accuracy.

## What has been found?

The study successfully identified a 200-marker epigenetic signature that forms the basis of the "Episwitch® CFS test". In an independent validation cohort, this test distinguished severe ME/CFS patients from healthy controls with 92% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 96% overall accuracy. Analysis of the identified genetic markers pointed to significant dysregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways, including those involving interleukins (IL-2), TNFα, and JAK/STAT signaling. These pathways overlap with the mechanisms of action for drugs like Rituximab 💊 and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) 💊, and the data allowed for the clear clustering of patients into distinct biological subgroups.

## Discussion

The authors note that a key strength of the study is its whole-genome approach, which captures the broad, system-level epigenetic dysregulation in ME/CFS. They identify several limitations, including that the test's specificity has not yet been confirmed against other chronic inflammatory conditions like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, which show some pathway overlap. Furthermore, because the study cohort was limited to severely ill, housebound patients, the test's applicability to mild or moderate ME/CFS is still unknown and requires further investigation.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that their genome-wide epigenetic screening has identified a highly accurate blood-based biomarker signature for severe ME/CFS. The discovery of distinct patient subgroups based on IL-2-related markers suggests a potential for future precision diagnostics and targeted immunomodulatory therapies. Future work must focus on validating these findings in larger, multi-center cohorts and testing the biomarker's ability to differentiate ME/CFS from other clinically similar diseases.

## Summary

This research provides a highly specific molecular link that may explain the debilitating muscle fatigue in post-COVID syndrome (PASC), a condition with similarities to **ME/CFS**. The finding that the inflammatory molecule **sIL2R** is extremely elevated and appears to directly harm muscle mitochondria in the lab suggests a potential root cause for the energy deficits. This is a critical step because it identifies a **specific, measurable factor** that could be targeted with new or existing treatments, such as neutralising antibodies or intravenous immunoglobulin 💊 (IVIG). If validated, sIL2R could become a valuable objective **biomarker** for diagnosing PASC and monitoring treatment response. The authors also suggest this "sIL2R-mitochondrial dysfunction axis" may explain similar post-viral fatigue conditions, potentially revolutionizing treatment approaches for the broader category of chronic fatigue syndromes.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether an elevated circulating inflammatory factor, **soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL2R)**, could be the direct cause of muscle mitochondrial dysfunction observed in patients with **Post-COVID Fatigue Syndrome (PASC)**. The core objective was to establish a mechanistic link between systemic immune dysregulation and the muscle pathology characteristic of persistent post-viral fatigue.

## Why was it researched?

Post-COVID fatigue affects millions globally, but the specific factors responsible for muscle dysfunction, despite documented mitochondrial abnormalities, have been speculative. Researchers hypothesized that T-cell-derived inflammatory mediators directly impair muscle mitochondrial function, driving the characteristic persistent fatigue in PASC.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective, cross-sectional study that analyzed clinical data and tissue samples from a small cohort of **11 PASC patients** experiencing fatigue for more than four weeks and **17 healthy controls**. Methodology included a **6-minute walk test** to assess functional impairment, **muscle biopsies** for histological and biochemical analyses, high-resolution respirometry (HRR) to measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and serum analysis to screen for 65 immune mediators. They also performed *in vitro* experiments, treating C2C12 muscle cell cultures directly with sIL2R to assess its effect on mitochondrial function.

## What has been found?

PASC patients showed a statistically significant **16.4% lower average distance** on the 6-minute walk test, alongside histological and biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, including a **30% reduction** in mitochondrial oxygen consumption driven by Complex I impairment. Serum analysis identified **sIL2R** as the most dramatically elevated factor, showing concentrations up to 5 log-fold higher in PASC patients. *In vitro* experiments confirmed that treating muscle cells with sIL2R directly caused significant reductions in mitochondrial respiration and reduced Complex III protein levels, demonstrating a direct pathogenic effect.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the primary limitation is the **small sample size**, which limits statistical power and generalizability, though the observed effect sizes were large and consistent. They also discuss that the findings are unlikely to be due to simple deconditioning because the patients had preserved muscle mass/strength and a specific pattern of Complex I impairment. The C2C12 cell model is a further limitation, suggesting the need for future studies using primary human muscle cells.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that **elevated sIL2R** is a possible cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in post-COVID fatigue, providing a novel molecular mechanism for the condition. These preliminary findings suggest that sIL2R may be a specific circulating factor mediating muscle dysfunction and could serve as a potential, druggable therapeutic target. Future work should focus on validating these results in much larger cohorts and further investigating the exact molecular mechanisms of sIL2R's effects on the muscle cell.

## Summary

This study is significant because it provides objective evidence that ME/CFS and Long COVID may not be the same condition at a physiological level, despite their outward similarities. For patients, this suggests that the "brain fog" and cognitive difficulties in ME/CFS may be directly linked to how the brain regulates its own blood supply during metabolic stress. Meanwhile, the findings in Long COVID suggest a different problem related to maintaining oxygen levels and heart-rhythm balance while upright. While these results are preliminary due to the small number of participants, they offer a path toward more precise diagnostic testing that could eventually move beyond symptom checklists to objective physical measurements.

## What was researched?

This pilot study aimed to identify whether ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit distinct physiological "phenotypes" (observable characteristics) despite their similar symptoms. Researchers specifically focused on how the autonomic nervous system and brain blood flow control react to stressors like low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, and standing upright.

## Why was it researched?

While ME/CFS and Long COVID share many clinical features—such as fatigue, brain fog, and autonomic dysfunction—it is unclear if they share the same underlying biological mechanisms. Because an increasing number of Long COVID patients are meeting the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, understanding the specific physiological differences between these groups is essential for improving diagnosis and developing targeted management strategies.

## How was it researched?

In this laboratory-based pilot study, researchers recruited 31 participants: 12 with mild/moderate ME/CFS, 9 with Long COVID (symptoms for >3 months), and 10 sedentary healthy controls. Participants underwent three specific tests: breathing a 5% carbon dioxide mixture (hypercapnia), breathing a 10% oxygen mixture (hypoxia), and a 5-minute 70° head-up tilt test to simulate standing. Throughout these trials, the team monitored respiratory, hemodynamic (blood flow), and cerebrovascular (brain blood vessel) variables, alongside assessments of resting vascular function and cognitive-motor integration (the brain's ability to coordinate thought and movement).

## What has been found?

The study found that while both patient groups had similar resting vascular function to healthy controls, they displayed unique physiological responses under stress. Patients with ME/CFS showed a significantly greater reduction in cerebrovascular resistance and impaired autoregulation in the brain when carbon dioxide levels were high, which coincided with impaired cognitive-motor integration. In contrast, patients with Long COVID experienced lower peripheral and end-tidal oxygen levels and a reduced "vagal withdrawal" (a specific parasympathetic nervous system response) while standing upright during the tilt test.

## Discussion

The authors note that these findings point toward distinct underlying causes for the symptoms in each group, with Long COVID appearing more related to oxygenation issues while standing and ME/CFS involving impaired control of blood flow within the brain. The study is limited by its small sample size, which characterizes it as a "pilot" investigation, and the results may be influenced by the duration of the participants' illnesses or the specific nature of the COVID-19 virus.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that ME/CFS and Long COVID represent unique physiological phenotypes, suggesting that different mechanisms drive their shared symptoms. Future research with larger patient cohorts is needed to confirm these findings and determine if these specific patterns of brain blood flow and oxygenation can be used as reliable diagnostic biomarkers or to tailor treatments for each condition.

## Summary

This study confirms that hypermobility disorders are far more than just "loose joints"; they are systemic conditions that frequently overlap with ME/CFS and dysautonomia. For patients, this research validates the severity of their lived experience, showing that the physical and autonomic burden of HSD/h-EDS can be more debilitating than that of many other high-profile chronic illnesses. By documenting the high prevalence of the HSD/POTS/MCAS triad, the study underscores the importance of screening for these related conditions during the diagnostic process. This objective data provides a strong argument for more comprehensive medical support and a shift in how these disorders are prioritized within the healthcare system.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the severity of autonomic nervous system symptoms, the frequency of co-occurring medical conditions (such as POTS, MCAS, and ME/CFS), and the overall quality of life in women diagnosed with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSD) or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (h-EDS). The goal was to quantify how these connective tissue disorders affect daily functioning and physical health.

While joint hypermobility is the hallmark of HSD and h-EDS, many patients suffer from widespread systemic issues including chronic pain, fatigue, and "dysautonomia" (malfunction of the autonomic nervous system). There has been limited data comparing the severity of these symptoms to other chronic illnesses, and researchers wanted to better understand the prevalence of the "clinical triad"—the simultaneous occurrence of hypermobility, POTS, and MCAS.

## How was it researched?

This was a cross-sectional study involving a cohort of 84 women with physician-diagnosed HSD or h-EDS who completed standardized, anonymous health questionnaires. The researchers used the COMPASS-31 scale to measure autonomic symptom severity, the SF-36 to assess quality of life (QoL), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to evaluate psychological impact. The data were then compared to existing benchmarks for other chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy.

## What has been found?

The study revealed an extremely high burden of illness: 98.8% of participants suffered from chronic pain, 58.3% had Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), 32.1% had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and 26.2% met the criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Notably, 25% of the women lived with the full "clinical triad" of HSD/h-EDS, POTS, and MCAS. Patients reported severe autonomic dysfunction and a quality of life that was significantly lower than that of patients with other major chronic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and lupus.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the autonomic burden in HSD and h-EDS is often underestimated and is actually more severe than in many well-recognized neurological and autoimmune conditions. A primary limitation noted is the relatively small, female-only cohort, which may not represent all individuals with these conditions. However, the study's strength lies in its use of validated tools to provide a clear comparison of the multisystemic nature of hypermobility disorders.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that women with HSD and h-EDS face a profound multisystemic health challenge characterized by severe dysautonomia and poor quality of life. They emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment that addresses the various comorbidities. Future research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this disease cluster and to develop more effective, targeted therapies for this patient population.

## Summary

This study identified a potential biomarker for PASC (Long Covid) by analyzing 195 different peptides in urine. This "PASC195" signature, which is heavily linked to collagen dysregulation, was able to successfully distinguish PASC patients from both healthy people and, notably, from patients with non-COVID-19 ME/CFS. This finding suggests that while PASC and ME/CFS share symptoms, their underlying molecular profiles may be different, which is a critical step for developing specific diagnostic tests. The discovery of this urinary signature provides a non-invasive tool that could, after much more research, complement or replace subjective symptom-based diagnosis. The study's computational analysis also pointed to existing drug classes (GLP-1 RA 💊 and MRA 💊) as potential treatments, offering a new direction for future clinical trials. However, the authors' inability to validate this signature in a second, different cohort highlights that the biomarker is not yet ready for clinical use and requires significant further validation.

## What was researched?

This study researched whether analyzing peptides (small protein fragments) in urine, a process called urinary peptidomics, could be used to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

## Why was it researched?

Currently, diagnosing PASC relies on symptom-based criteria, which can be uncertain and subjective. The researchers hypothesized that analyzing urinary peptides could provide a more objective, non-invasive way to diagnose PASC and offer new insights into its underlying disease mechanisms, which remain unclear.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study that used capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) to analyze urine samples from 50 PASC patients (approximately 10 months post-infection) and 50 controls. The control group included 42 healthy individuals and 8 patients with non-COVID-19-associated myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The researchers used a machine learning model (support vector machine) to identify significant differences in peptide abundance and build a diagnostic classifier from a training set (n=60), which was then tested on a separate validation set (n=40).

## What has been found?

The researchers identified a unique signature of 195 urinary peptides, named **PASC195**, that was significantly different in PASC patients compared to controls. This signature, characterized mainly by a predominant abundance of collagen alpha chains, was able to effectively distinguish PASC cases from both healthy controls and non-COVID-19 ME/CFS patients with high accuracy (AUC of 0.962) in the validation set. The identified peptides suggest PASC involves dysregulated collagen, ongoing inflammation, and endothelial damage. A computational (in silico) analysis also suggested that GLP-1 RA 💊 and MRA 💊 (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) might be potentially beneficial interventions.

## Discussion

The authors note that the PASC195 classifier could not be validated in a separate, independent cohort (UriCoV), which limits the generalizability of the findings. They suggest this was likely due to differences in cohort selection, how "cases" were defined (clinician-diagnosed vs. self-reported), and the timing of sample collection (10 months vs. 3 years post-infection). The study was also limited by its small sample size, which prevented subgroup analyses (e.g., by sex or age).

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that they have identified a promising, non-invasive urinary peptide signature (PASC195) that could potentially advance PASC diagnostics. They state that this signature reflects the underlying molecular pathophysiology of PASC. Future longitudinal studies with larger, more diverse cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and validate the biomarker.

## Summary

This pilot study provides preliminary but promising evidence for a new treatment target in ME/CFS. It suggests that a subgroup of patients may have symptoms driven by an overactive mTOR pathway and a stalled cellular cleaning process (autophagy). The use of low-dose rapamycin 💊, an existing FDA-approved drug, to correct this issue resulted in significant symptom improvement for many in the trial, particularly in fatigue and PEM. This research is important because it not only tests a potential therapy but also provides clinical evidence for a specific biological mechanism (mTOR-driven autophagy impairment) in the disease. The biomarkers used, BECLIN-1 and pSer258-ATG13, could become crucial tools for developing diagnostic tests to identify which patients might benefit from this type of treatment in the future. However, these are early findings from a small, uncontrolled study, and more rigorous, placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the drug's safety and effectiveness.

## What was researched?

This pilot study investigated the safety and efficacy of low-dose rapamycin 💊 in patients with ME/CFS. The primary goal was to determine if this treatment could alleviate core symptoms like fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) by improving autophagy, a cellular cleaning and recycling process.

## Why was it researched?

The study was prompted by previous findings that ME/CFS is associated with chronic inflammation and impaired autophagy, both of which may be linked to the over-activation of a cellular pathway called mTOR. Since rapamycin 💊 is a well-known mTOR inhibitor , researchers hypothesized it could restore the autophagy process and, in turn, improve the clinical symptoms of ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This was a decentralized, uncontrolled, observational pilot study involving 86 ME/CFS patients who initiated therapy. Participants were administered a low dose of rapamycin 💊, which was gradually increased to a target of 6 mg/week. Clinical symptoms were assessed using self-reported questionnaires (including BAS, SSS, MFI, and SF-36) at baseline and at 36, 60, and 90 days. Blood samples were collected at the same time points to measure plasma levels of key autophagy markers, BECLIN-1 and pSer258-ATG13, and correlate them with symptom changes.

## What has been found?

The 6 mg/week low-dose rapamycin 💊 regimen was well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events (SAEs) reported. The study found statistically significant reductions in key ME/CFS symptoms, including PEM, fatigue, disturbed sleep, and orthostatic intolerance, as measured by validated questionnaires. These clinical improvements were accompanied by molecular changes indicating restored autophagy: plasma levels of the inhibitory marker pSer258-ATG13 were strongly downregulated , while levels of the autophagy-promoting marker BECLIN-1 were significantly increased. Improvements in symptoms (like PEM and fatigue) correlated significantly with these positive biomarker changes.

## Discussion

The authors identify several key limitations, most notably the "absence of a placebo control group," which makes it impossible to definitively attribute symptom improvements to the drug rather than a placebo effect. The trial also relied solely on self-reported questionnaires for outcomes , had a high dropout rate (often for financial reasons or a lack of perceived benefit) , and did not use a standardized drug formulation, which could affect bioavailability. Despite these limitations, the authors highlight the study's strength as one of the first biomarker-targeted trials for ME/CFS, providing clinical evidence that links mTOR-driven autophagy impairment to the disease's pathophysiology.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that low-dose rapamycin 💊 effectively reduced key ME/CFS symptoms in this cohort, and that these clinical improvements were mechanistically linked to the restoration of autophagy via mTOR inhibition. Future research should focus on dose optimization and developing biomarker tests to identify which patients are most likely to respond. An enhanced, larger trial is planned which will include a placebo-controlled crossover design and objective monitoring with wearable devices.

## Summary

This computational study offers a potential genetic explanation for why some individuals develop ME/CFS after a viral infection while others recover. It suggests the risk may depend on how a person's specific immune system genes (their HLA type) equip them to "grab" and clear out the infection. The finding that ME/CFS "risk" genes are poor at binding to herpesvirus proteins supports the "persistent antigen" hypothesis, where leftover parts of the virus may remain in the body, driving chronic symptoms. This research is significant because it suggests a common underlying mechanism for ME/CFS, Long COVID, and post-Lyme disease, which could help unify research and diagnostic strategies for these overlapping conditions.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the link between specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles (gene variants) that are known to either increase risk for or protect against ME/CFS. The researchers tested the hypothesis that this risk or protection is directly related to how strongly these specific HLA molecules can bind to antigens (protein fragments) from Human Herpes Viruses (HHV), which are often implicated in ME/CFS.

## Why was it researched?

Viral infections are widely suspected as a trigger for ME/CFS , and separate research has identified a genetic component related to HLA alleles. This study aimed to connect these two observations, proposing that an individual's specific HLA "immunogenetic makeup" modulates their immune response to a viral insult. The hypothesis was that poor HLA binding might allow viral antigens to persist, contributing to chronic illness.

## How was it researched?

This was an *in silico* (computational) study that predicted the binding strength (affinity) of specific HLA alleles to pathogen proteins. The researchers analyzed two HLA alleles associated with ME/CFS susceptibility (C*07:04, DQB1*03:03) and two associated with protection (B*08:01, DPB1*02:01). They tested the binding of these alleles against over 10,000 antigens from the 9 Human Herpes Viruses. The analysis was then extended to pathogens linked to Long COVID (SARS-CoV-2) and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) (*Borrelia burgdorferi*).

## What has been found?

The study found that the ME/CFS "susceptibility" (risk) alleles had significantly weaker binding affinity to all HHV antigens compared to the "protective" alleles ($P<0.001$). None of the HHV antigens showed strong binding to the risk alleles, whereas the protective alleles showed strong bindings. This same pattern was observed for the other pathogens: the ME/CFS risk alleles also had very weak binding to SARS-CoV-2 and *Borrelia burgdorferi* proteins, while the ME/CFS protective alleles showed strong bindings.

## Discussion

The authors note several limitations of the study. The analyses were limited to only 4 specific HLA alleles that were previously identified. It is possible that other HLA alleles not investigated in this study may also contribute to ME/CFS risk or protection. Similarly, the study focused on HHVs, but the authors acknowledge it is likely that weak HLA binding to other pathogens (e.g., enteroviruses) may also be involved in ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that these findings support the hypothesis that ME/CFS, Long COVID, and PTLDS may share a common cause: persistent pathogenic antigens that the patient's immune system could not eliminate due to an "inadequate" HLA makeup. They speculate that strong HLA binding protects against ME/CFS by eliminating these antigens, while weak binding allows them to persist and contribute to chronic illness. Future work is implied to investigate other HLA alleles and a wider range of pathogens.

## Summary

This research demonstrates that advanced artificial intelligence can accurately identify ME/CFS patients using blood metabolic profiles, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of over 87%. By decoding the AI's decision-making process, the study provides biochemical evidence supporting patient experiences of energy deficits, pointing specifically to blocks in the cellular energy cycles (mitochondria) and muscle metabolism. This supports the validity of ME/CFS as a physiological condition with measurable biological abnormalities. While not yet a commercially available test, this approach highlights specific targets—such as the glycolysis-TCA transition and specific lipids—that could form the basis for future clinical diagnostics and targeted treatments.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the use of advanced Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to detect ME/CFS by analyzing plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. The researchers aimed to identify a high-performance predictive model and use Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to interpret the biological meaning behind the model's decisions. Specifically, they benchmarked three AutoML frameworks—TPOT, Auto-Sklearn, and H2O AutoML—to see which could most accurately distinguish patients from healthy controls.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a complex disease that currently lacks objective diagnostic biomarkers, leading to delayed diagnoses and inadequate management. While metabolomics offers a window into the cellular activity of the disease, the data is high-dimensional and difficult to analyze using traditional statistical methods. The authors utilized AutoML to automate the complex process of model selection and optimization, hoping to discover robust diagnostic patterns and biological insights that might be missed by human experts or standard techniques.

## How was it researched?

The study utilized a publicly available dataset containing 888 metabolic features (metabolites and lipids) from 106 ME/CFS patients and 91 matched healthy controls. The researchers cleaned the data and imputed missing values using a method called MICE. They then trained three different AutoML frameworks under identical time constraints to classify the participants. The models were validated using a rigorous process called Repeated Random Sub-sampling (repeated 100 times) to ensure the results were reliable. Finally, they used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) analysis to visualize which specific metabolites were most important for the model's predictions.

## What has been found?

The TPOT framework significantly outperformed the other models, achieving a high diagnostic accuracy of 87.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.8% and specificity of 89.0%. Through SHAP analysis, the optimal model identified a distinct metabolic signature for ME/CFS. Key findings included elevated levels of succinic acid and pyruvic acid, suggesting disruptions in mitochondrial energy metabolism (specifically the TCA cycle and glycolysis transition). The model also identified decreased levels of leucine (linked to muscle fatigue) and prostaglandin $D_{2}$ (an inflammatory mediator), as well as alterations in gut-brain axis markers like glycocholic acid.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that their TPOT-derived model provides both a robust diagnostic tool and biologically interpretable insights. The identification of elevated pyruvate and succinate supports the "mitochondrial bottleneck" hypothesis and metabolic inflexibility often reported in ME/CFS literature. They note that the decrease in prostaglandin $D_{2}$ was unexpected and may suggest a compensatory shift in chronic inflammation pathways rather than simple immune activation. Limitations of the study include the relatively small sample size, the cross-sectional nature of the data (which prevents proving cause-and-effect), and the lack of real-time symptom tracking during blood collection.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that combining AutoML with explainable AI is a powerful approach for distilling complex metabolic data into accurate diagnostics for ME/CFS. The results reinforce the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid metabolism issues, and gut-brain axis dysregulation in the disease's pathophysiology. Future research should focus on larger independent cohorts, integration with other "omics" data (like proteomics), and longitudinal studies that track metabolite levels alongside symptom fluctuations.

## Summary

This study suggests that Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) may be a feasible and beneficial treatment for some ME/CFS patients, leading to improvements in physical function, fatigue, pain, and cognition. The research also provides a possible biological explanation for these improvements, linking them to a "normalization" of brain connectivity in the thalamus, a key sensory and motor hub. This finding connects with other research suggesting brain network dysregulation is a core feature of ME/CFS. While promising, these results are from a small, uncontrolled, observational study, meaning a placebo effect cannot be ruled out. The authors stress that larger, placebo-controlled trials are required to prove that HBOT is truly effective.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) 💊 in patients with ME/CFS. The researchers also investigated the treatment's effects on functional brain changes by using fMRI.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating disorder characterized by profound fatigue, cognitive impairment, and severe physical dysfunction. While HBOT has been proposed as a potential treatment, its effects on ME/CFS patients have remained "largely unexplored," creating a need for this investigation.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective cohort study involving 30 ME/CFS patients who each received 40 sessions of HBOT. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, during, and four weeks post-treatment using patient questionnaires (like the SF-36), functional tests (like handgrip strength and exercise capacity), and cognitive tests. Brain functional connectivity (FC) was measured with MRI and compared to 30 matched healthy controls.

## What has been found?

HBOT was associated with significant improvements in physical functioning, fatigue, pain, exercise capacity, muscle strength, and information processing speed. Treatment adherence was high and the therapy was well-tolerated. Brain fMRI revealed that ME/CFS patients had thalamic hyperconnectivity (increased functional connectivity) at baseline compared to healthy controls, and this hyperconnectivity "normalized" after the HBOT treatment. Patients who showed a clinical response (defined as a $\ge10$ point increase in SF-36 PF) had greater reductions in this hyperconnectivity.

## Discussion

The authors highlight the study's strengths, including its multidimensional assessment (integrating patient-reported, physician-assessed, and neuroimaging data) and the high patient adherence to the protocol. Key limitations include the small sample size, the observational, non-controlled design, and the absence of a sham-treated (placebo) control group. The study also excluded severely affected, homebound patients, so the findings may not apply to that group.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that HBOT was well-tolerated and associated with significant clinical improvements and the normalization of thalamic hyperconnectivity, suggesting a potential role for this brain mechanism in ME/CFS pathophysiology. This observational study provides a strong rationale for larger, randomized controlled trials to confirm the treatment's efficacy.

## Summary

This conference report indicates that research is making significant progress in identifying the biological causes of ME/CFS. Several distinct problems are being targeted, including autoimmunity (rogue antibodies), cellular energy problems (Warburg effect), and ion channel dysfunction. This is leading to multiple new clinical trials for existing drugs like daratumumab, low-dose naltrexone, and even the supplement oxaloacetate, which have shown positive initial results. This suggests a shift away from one-size-fits-all treatments and toward a future where patients might receive therapies targeted at their specific biological subgroup.

## What was researched?

This news article reports on the IACFS/ME 2025 conference, summarizing multiple research presentations. The focus was on new findings regarding the underlying pathomechanisms of ME/CFS and long COVID, and the potential treatment approaches that target these identified abnormalities.

## Why was it researched?

The article aims to synthesize emerging research to provide an update on the field. A better understanding of the pathophysiology—including neuroinflammation, immune dysfunction, and metabolic issues—is necessary to move beyond supportive care and develop targeted treatments for the complex, multisystem nature of ME/CFS.

## How was it researched?

This article is a piece of conference journalism. The author summarized keynote presentations and interviews with several prominent researchers, including Dr. Luis Nacul, Dr. Carmen Scheibenbogen, Dr. Øystein Fluge, Dr. Sonya Gradisnik-Marshall, and Dr. Suzanne D. Vernon. It reports on the designs and initial findings of their respective recent and ongoing studies.

## What has been found?

The conference highlighted several key research areas. Drs. Scheibenbogen and Fluge presented evidence for autoimmunity in a subset of patients, with ongoing trials for antibody-targeting drugs like daratumumab 💊 and a new trial for rituximab 💊. Dr. Gradisnik-Marshall's work showed that low-dose naltrexone 💊 may restore function to dysfunctional TRPM3 ion channels in long COVID. Dr. Vernon's studies suggested that oxaloacetate 💊 can reduce fatigue by addressing metabolic dysfunction related to the "Warburg Effect."

## Discussion

The speakers, including Dr. Nacul, emphasized that ME/CFS is a heterogeneous disease and that a "magic pill" is unlikely. They suggest that combination therapies, or different treatments for different patient subgroups (like those with autoimmune markers), will be necessary. Dr. Fluge noted that while pharmaceutical interest has been low, the accumulating objective data is likely to change that.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The article concludes that research is increasingly identifying specific, targetable abnormalities in ME/CFS and long COVID. Ongoing clinical trials for various immunomodulating and metabolic drugs (daratumumab, rituximab, low-dose naltrexone, oxaloacetate) represent promising new avenues for treatment based on these pathogenic mechanisms.

## Summary

This study maps a direct molecular pathway between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the development of 'brain fog' and neurodegenerative markers. It demonstrates that the viral protein can trick brain cells into a state of hypoxia-like dysfunction, leading to the clumping of toxic proteins similar to those found in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Crucially, the research identifies metformin 💊 as a potential treatment that can block this damage and restore healthy brain gene expression. These findings provide a scientific foundation for clinical trials using this existing, low-cost medication to help patients suffering from Long COVID cognitive decline.

## What was researched?

The study investigated the molecular mechanisms through which the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein causes cognitive impairment and memory loss. It specifically explored whether the common diabetes medication metformin 💊 could prevent or reverse these neurological changes.

## Why was it researched?

While many COVID-19 survivors experience persistent 'brain fog,' the exact process of how the virus affects the brain's internal hardware remained unclear. Researchers wanted to understand if the persistent presence of viral proteins contributes to long-term cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.

## How was it researched?

The researchers used a rat model where the S1 spike protein was administered intranasally to see how it affected brain tissue and behavior over six weeks. They also conducted genetic analysis (mRNA sequencing) and used human neuronal cell lines to study how the protein interacts with cellular switches like HIF-1α.

## What has been found?

The spike protein entered the brain and stabilized a protein called HIF-1α, which acted as a faulty switch that turned off genes required for healthy brain connections (synapses). By six weeks, this process led to significant neuronal loss and the accumulation of toxic proteins, including phosphorylated tau and alpha-synuclein. Metformin was found to block this 'hypoxia' switch and significantly reduce the clumping of these harmful proteins, effectively protecting the brain's cognitive function.

## Discussion

The study suggests that cognitive damage from COVID-19 is not just general inflammation but a specific genetic disruption that mirrors early neurodegenerative disease. While the results are promising, the researchers note that the spike protein behavior in a chronic infection model may differ from the temporary exposure seen in vaccinations.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly triggers a cascade leading to memory loss and neurodegenerative-like protein clumping. Metformin is a viable candidate for therapeutic intervention to mitigate the long-term cognitive consequences of COVID-19.

## Summary

This study provides strong evidence that a significant subgroup of ME/CFS patients, estimated at up to 25%, has clinically relevant mast cell activation (MCA). The research establishes a clear association between this MCA involvement and a higher prevalence of orthostatic intolerance (OI), particularly POTS. This is a crucial finding for patients, as it suggests that identifying MCA is key to personalizing treatment. The study showed that ME/CFS patients with both MCA and OI reported significant symptom improvement from mast cell-targeted therapies, offering a potential treatment pathway for this subgroup. This research underscores the importance of screening for MCA to better manage OI symptoms and improve outcomes for this patient cohort.

## What was researched?

This study investigated how common mast cell activation (MCA) is in an Austrian cohort of ME/CFS patients. It also explored the clinical relevance of MCA and its relationship with orthostatic intolerance (OI), particularly postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

## Why was it researched?

Growing evidence suggests that mast cell activation (MCA) may contribute to ME/CFS symptoms , and researchers have noted an overlap in symptoms like orthostatic intolerance (OI) and POTS between ME/CFS and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). However, the extent to which MCA plays a role in the pathophysiology of OI within the ME/CFS population was still unknown. This research aimed to stratify patients to help identify subgroups and improve personalized treatment options.

## How was it researched?

The researchers analyzed two data sets. The first was a large online questionnaire (CCCFS cohort) with 687 self-reporting ME/CFS patients from German-speaking regions. The second was a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 383 Austrian ME/CFS patients (ME/CFS-MCA cohort) from a specialized neurology practice. The data was analyzed to compare the prevalence of OI and treatment responses in patients with and without diagnosed or suspected mast cell activation.

## What has been found?

The study found that MCA is a frequent comorbidity, with its prevalence increasing over the course of the disease; up to 25.3% of patients in one cohort met the criteria for clinically relevant MCA. In both patient cohorts, orthostatic intolerance (OI), and specifically POTS, was significantly more common in ME/CFS patients who also had MCA involvement. Patients with both MCAS and OI reported significant symptom improvement from **mast cell-targeted treatment** 💊 ($p<0.0001$). This subgroup also responded more frequently to **IF-channel inhibitors** 💊 ($p=0.076$), but showed no significant difference in response to beta blockers, compared to patients without MCAS.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the reliance on self-reported data in the first cohort and the retrospective (looking-back) design of the second. They also note that results from Austrian cohorts may not be fully generalizable to other populations. A key issue highlighted was the lack of laboratory testing for MCAS in most patients (only 3.1% in one cohort), even when clinically suspected, which underscores a gap in current diagnostic practices.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that mast cell activation (MCA) is a frequent and clinically relevant comorbidity in ME/CFS that is strongly associated with a higher prevalence of OI, especially POTS. They suggest that stratifying ME/CFS patients based on MCA involvement is essential for tailoring personalized treatment approaches. Future research should use laboratory testing to validate these findings and explore the overlapping biological pathways.

## Summary

This review consolidates scientific evidence confirming that ME/CFS is a biological illness rooted in an individual's genetics and cellular function. It highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a central explanation for the profound energy deficits and post-exertional malaise. The paper also explains how environmental triggers, like viruses, may cause lasting epigenetic changes (altering how genes are switched on or off), leading to chronic immune dysregulation. By connecting these findings, the research supports the development of objective biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies, such as targeting mitochondrial function with supplements like **Coenzyme Q10** 💊 or **L-carnitine** 💊, or reducing oxidative stress. This integrated understanding is a crucial step toward creating personalized treatments that address the specific molecular issues in ME/CFS.

## What was researched?

This paper is a comprehensive literature review that synthesizes current scientific evidence on the role of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in the development and pathology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS). It examines genetic predispositions, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation). The review also explores how these molecular findings could be translated into DNA-based biomarkers for diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a debilitating, multisystem disorder, but the specific molecular mechanisms that cause it remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding has hindered the development of reliable diagnostic tests and effective treatments. This review was conducted to consolidate the growing body of research on the genetic and epigenetic factors of ME/CFS to clarify its underlying biology and identify promising paths toward precision medicine.

## How was it researched?

This study is a literature review, not a new experimental study with patients. The authors gathered and synthesized the latest peer-reviewed evidence from a wide range of existing research. This included foundational research, such as twin studies and candidate gene studies, as well as recent large-scale genomic projects (like DecodeME) and multi-omics analyses. The paper connects findings from genetics, epigenetics, and mitochondrial research to build a cohesive picture of the disease's molecular basis.

## What has been found?

The review confirms that evidence supports a genetic component to ME/CFS, shown by familial clustering and heritability data from twin studies. A central finding is the significant role of mitochondrial dysfunction, which impairs cellular energy (ATP) production and is linked to oxidative stress. The authors also highlight that epigenetic modifications—changes in how genes are expressed without altering the DNA sequence—serve as a key link between environmental triggers (like viruses) and chronic illness. These changes can lead to immune dysregulation and the activation of dormant "transposable elements," which may mimic a viral infection and drive chronic inflammation.

## Discussion

The authors identify several key challenges in translating this research into clinical practice. The primary obstacle is the significant biological heterogeneity among ME/CFS patients, which makes it difficult to find one-size-fits-all biomarkers or treatments. Another major challenge is distinguishing between molecular changes that *cause* the disease and those that are a *consequence* of chronic illness. The review also emphasizes that genetic and epigenetic findings must be replicated across diverse, multi-ethnic populations to ensure they are universally applicable.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that DNA plays a profound and multifaceted role in ME/CFS, involving genetic susceptibility, significant mitochondrial dysfunction, and dynamic epigenetic changes that drive immune and metabolic problems. They strongly advocate for an integrative "multi-omics" approach, which combines genomic, epigenomic, and other molecular data, as crucial for future research. This comprehensive approach is considered essential for discovering objective biomarkers and developing personalized treatments that target the root molecular causes of the disease.

## Summary

This review confirms the significant lack of high-quality evidence for POTS treatments, a gap strongly felt by patients. It systematically organizes the existing, low-level evidence, identifying non-drug approaches like compression garments and salt supplementation as reasonable first-line steps. The most critical finding for the ME/CFS community is the complete absence of studies specifically addressing POTS treatment in the context of ME/CFS. The authors explicitly note that standard physical training, a common POTS recommendation, may be unrealistic or harmful for ME/CFS patients due to the risk of post-exertional malaise (PEM). This review validates the need for research that focuses on this specific patient subgroup.

## What was researched?

This systematic review was conducted to present the current knowledge on non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment approaches for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). The review had a special focus on finding therapeutic options for children and for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

## Why was it researched?

POTS is a common co-occurring condition in adults and children who have ME/CFS. Despite this, therapeutic recommendations for POTS are rare in clinical practice, and there is a significant lack of evidence to guide treatment. This review aimed to collate all existing evidence to address this knowledge gap.

## How was it researched?

This was a systematic literature review  that followed PRISMA guidelines. The authors searched multiple scientific databases like PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase, screening an initial 3,853 studies. They ultimately included 45 studies in their final analysis, which consisted of 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 27 non-randomized trials (non-RCTs).

## What has been found?

The review found that overall evidence for POTS therapy is rare, and large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are urgently needed. Among non-pharmacological options, compression garments, physical training, salt supplementation, and transdermal vagal nerve stimulation were identified as possible first-line treatments. For pharmaceuticals, studies showed significant effects from **ivabradine** 💊 and **&beta;-adrenergic blocking agents** 💊. Single studies also suggested that **midodrine** 💊 (hydrochloride) and **pyridostigmine** 💊 may have beneficial effects. Despite one of its main goals, the review found no studies that specifically addressed the treatment of POTS in patients with ME/CFS.

## Discussion

The authors state the review followed high-quality Cochrane methodological standards. However, the primary limitation is the quality of the available data; the certainty of evidence for most interventions was rated as "low or very low". This was because most studies had a small number of participants  and a "substantial risk of bias". The authors also note that studies often failed to differentiate between adult and pediatric patients or between different subtypes of POTS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that non-pharmacological options like compression garments, physical training, and salt supplementation should be the first-line therapeutic approach. If these are insufficient, &beta;-adrenergic blocking agents and ivabradine can be considered , with pyridostigmine and midodrine as potential add-on therapies. The authors stress that future research must consist of larger, long-term studies  and that "studies which specifically address therapeutic options in patients with POTS and ME/CFS are essential".

## Summary

This study provides strong objective evidence for the biological processes underlying PEM. It demonstrates that in ME/CFS patients, the body's response to exercise is "maladaptive," particularly during the 24-hour recovery period. Instead of returning to normal, patients experience persistent and widespread dysregulation of their immune and metabolic systems, including signs of mitochondrial stress. The research successfully links these specific molecular abnormalities to both reduced exercise capacity and hallmark ME/CFS symptoms like muscle pain and sore throat, reinforcing that PEM is a distinct pathological process.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the molecular underpinnings of post-exertional malaise (PEM), the primary symptom of ME/CFS. Researchers performed a detailed, longitudinal analysis of 6,361 unique plasma proteins to see how they change in ME/CFS patients compared to controls following a strenuous exercise challenge designed to induce PEM.

## Why was it researched?

While PEM is the overarching symptom of ME/CFS, the biological mechanisms that cause this exacerbation of symptoms after exertion are unknown. This research aimed to identify objective molecular changes that occur during the recovery period, providing a biological basis for PEM and distinguishing disease-specific changes from those caused by simple physical deconditioning.

## How was it researched?

The study included 132 individuals: 79 ME/CFS patients and 53 age- and BMI-matched sedentary controls. All participants underwent two maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by a 24-hour recovery period. Plasma proteomics were analyzed at four different time points using the Somascan® 7K assay to monitor protein changes over time.

## What has been found?

The most pronounced proteomic changes were seen in ME/CFS participants during the recovery phase, which coincides with the onset of PEM. Compared to controls, ME/CFS subjects showed persistent dysregulation of immune, metabolic, and neuromuscular pathways. Key findings included the suppression of T and B cell signaling, downregulation of IL-17 pathways, and an upregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, which suggests mitochondrial stress and impaired immune recovery. These protein changes were also correlated with symptom severity (like muscle pain, sore throat, and lymph node tenderness) and impaired exercise performance (VO2max).

## Discussion

The authors highlight the strength of their study design, particularly the use of *sedentary* controls, which allowed them to isolate molecular alterations specific to ME/CFS rather than those related to deconditioning. The study also provides valuable new data on the molecular response to exercise in a predominantly female sedentary cohort, a population historically underrepresented in exercise physiology research. Furthermore, the discovery of distinct responses between males and females underscores the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in ME/CFS research.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that dynamic, longitudinal proteomic profiling is a valuable tool for characterizing the maladaptive response to exertion in ME/CFS. The findings provide a molecular foundation for a deeper mechanistic investigation into the pathology of PEM.

## Summary

This comprehensive study provides biological validation for the severe symptoms reported by ME/CFS patients and elucidates why the condition presents differently in males and females. It links specific immune abnormalities, such as gut leakiness and neuroinflammation, directly to hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone in women and low cortisol in both sexes. The identification of neuroinflammatory gene signatures in females offers a potential explanation for cognitive dysfunction ("brain fog"). Importantly, these findings propose a concrete, testable path for treatment: regulating sex hormones and cortisol levels to help restore immune homeostasis.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the biological differences between male and female Long COVID (LC) patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The researchers utilized a multi-omics approach to profile immune cell phenotypes, hormone levels, and gene expression patterns to identify sex-specific mechanisms driving the disease.

## Why was it researched?

Females are disproportionately affected by LC and ME/CFS, comprising approximately 70% of cases, yet the biological reasons for this disparity remain unclear. While sex differences in acute COVID-19 are well-documented, less is known about how sex influences the chronic phase of the disease. The authors aimed to uncover specific immune and hormonal dysregulations that could explain why females are more susceptible and to identify potential targets for personalized, sex-specific treatments.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study involving 78 LC patients with ME/CFS (58 females and 20 males) and 62 age- and sex-matched recovered controls who had COVID-19 but did not develop long-term symptoms. They analyzed blood samples using flow cytometry to count immune cells, multiplex ELISAs to measure cytokines, chemokines, and hormones, and bulk RNA sequencing to examine gene expression. The study specifically correlated these biological markers with clinical symptoms like fatigue and cognitive impairment.

## What has been found?

The study identified distinct biological signatures for males and females.  Female patients (LCF) exhibited a "shift toward myelopoiesis," characterized by increased neutrophils and monocytes, reduced lymphocytes, and depleted regulatory T cells (Tregs), indicating persistent immune activation. Females also showed elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells (immature red blood cells), markers of gut barrier dysfunction (I-FABP, LPS-BP), and a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Hormonally, females had significantly reduced testosterone, while males had reduced estradiol; notably, cortisol levels were low in both sexes [cite: 58, 208-210]. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that females had upregulated genes associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction (e.g., *ZNF469*, *BRINP2*, *Reln*), which correlated with "brain fog" symptoms [cite: 416-418, 493]. Males showed a different profile with less severe inflammation and gene expression related to cellular stress and tissue repair.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how the reduced levels of sex hormones (testosterone in females, estradiol in males) and cortisol likely contribute to the observed immune dysregulation, as these hormones typically have anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory roles.  They highlight that the elevated gut leakage markers in females suggest microbial translocation may be driving systemic inflammation specifically in that group. The study acknowledges limitations, including unequal sample sizes between sexes and the cross-sectional design, which prevents tracking changes over time.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that LC with ME/CFS is a multifaceted disease with profound sex-specific differences, where females experience more severe inflammation and neuro-immune dysregulation. They suggest that correcting hormonal imbalances—specifically considering hormone replacement therapy to restore testosterone in females and estradiol in males—could be a potential therapeutic strategy. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the causal role of these hormonal pathways.

## Summary

This review identifies a major blind spot in ME/CFS research by shifting the focus from blood-based testing to mucosal tissues like the gut and mouth. It suggests that many previous studies failed to find viral evidence simply because they were looking in the wrong place, as viruses often hide in mucosal reservoirs. This perspective provides a new framework for developing diagnostic tests and targeted therapies that address localized viral persistence rather than systemic infection.

## What was researched?

This review investigated the potential role of persistent and reactivating viruses within mucosal tissues, such as the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, as a primary driver of ME/CFS.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers sought to explain why blood-based viral studies in ME/CFS are often inconsistent despite most patients reporting a viral onset of their illness. Mucosal sites are primary entry points for pathogens and can serve as long-term reservoirs that the immune system in the blood may not fully reflect.

## How was it researched?

The authors synthesized existing literature on viral detection in ME/CFS, specifically contrasting results from peripheral blood samples with those from mucosal sites like saliva and gut biopsies. They focused on common viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesviruses (HHV-6), and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs).

## What has been found?

The findings indicate that mucosal tissues often harbor evidence of active or latent viruses even when those same viruses are undetectable in the blood. Specifically, evidence of HERVs and herpesvirus reactivation in saliva and gut biopsies suggests these sites may maintain the chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation seen in patients.

## Discussion

A key limitation noted is the historical over-reliance on blood samples due to the invasive nature of mucosal biopsies. However, the authors argue that saliva and stool analysis offer less invasive windows into these critical mucosal environments.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that mucosal viruses are a likely 'missing piece' of the ME/CFS puzzle. Future research should prioritize multi-site sampling to better understand how localized viral persistence contributes to the systemic symptoms of the disease.

## Summary

This research provides crucial evidence that some Long COVID symptoms, particularly chronic pain and sensory sensitivity, have a direct autoimmune cause. By showing that antibodies from patients can "transfer" these symptoms to mice, the study moves beyond observation and suggests that the immune system is actively attacking parts of the nervous system. While the study did not find a direct link to cognitive "brain fog" in this specific animal model, the discovery that antibodies settle in the sensory nerve clusters (dorsal root ganglia) offers a clear physical target for future diagnostics. This supports the growing scientific consensus that Long COVID involves measurable biological dysfunction in the immune-nervous system interface, similar to findings in ME/CFS and fibromyalgia.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from Long COVID patients with neurological symptoms (such as brain fog, pain, and fatigue) could cause similar symptoms in healthy mice. The researchers specifically focused on whether these antibodies bind to the nervous system and trigger sensory, cognitive, or psychiatric impairments.

## Why was it researched?

Approximately 30% of Long COVID patients experience persistent neurological issues, but the exact cause remains unknown. A leading hypothesis is that these symptoms are driven by an autoimmune response involving autoantibodies that attack the nervous system. This research sought to prove a causal link by determining if transferring purified antibodies from patients into animals would replicate the disease manifestations.

## How was it researched?

This was a passive transfer laboratory study using a cohort of 90 Long COVID patients (defined by WHO criteria) and age/sex-matched healthy controls. Researchers purified IgG antibodies from the participants' blood and injected them into C57Bl/6J mice for four consecutive days. The mice were then subjected to a battery of behavioral tests over two weeks to assess pain sensitivity, spatial memory, anxiety, and depression. The team also used fluorescent imaging and tissue analysis to track where the human antibodies settled within the mice's nervous systems.

## What has been found?

The study found that mice receiving Long COVID IgG developed a significant but temporary increase in mechanical pain sensitivity (allodynia) during the first week. This effect was specifically tied to the antibodies, as it was abolished when the IgG was removed from the serum or broken down with the enzyme papain 💊. Interestingly, the mice did not display impairments in memory, anxiety, or depression behaviors. Anatomical analysis revealed that the Long COVID antibodies accumulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia and attached directly to sensory neurons, although no signs of neuroinflammation were detected in the brain.

## Discussion

The authors note that while the study successfully replicated sensory pain, it failed to trigger cognitive "brain fog" or psychiatric symptoms in the mice. They suggest this might be due to the short duration of the experiment, a potential requirement for higher antibody doses, or the difficulty of modeling complex human cognitive symptoms in a mouse model. The researchers emphasize that the binding of IgG to peripheral sensory nerves strongly supports the concept of "autoimmune pain" in the Long COVID spectrum.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that IgG autoantibodies from Long COVID patients are pathogenic and directly contribute to sensory symptoms by targeting peripheral sensory neurons. They suggest that future research should focus on identifying the specific self-antigens (proteins) these antibodies target and investigating alternative mechanisms that might explain cognitive symptoms. This work highlights the potential for antibody-targeted therapies, such as plasma exchange or specific immune modulators, in treating neurological Long COVID.

## Summary

This research identifies a specific subpopulation of immune cells that appears to be a primary driver of inflammation in ME/CFS. By pinpointing exactly which cells are 'reprogrammed' at the epigenetic level, the study provides a concrete target for future diagnostic tests and treatments aimed at stopping the inflammatory response that causes symptoms like post-exertional malaise.

## What was researched?

The study investigated how the gene regulatory landscape and chromatin accessibility of immune cells are reshaped in ME/CFS patients, particularly during post-exertional malaise (PEM).

## Why was it researched?

While previous studies identified general immune dysregulation in ME/CFS, it remained unclear which specific cell subsets were responsible for driving inflammation and how their internal 'genetic switches' were altered during symptom flares.

## How was it researched?

Researchers generated single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles (scATAC-seq) and transcriptomic data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients and healthy controls. These samples were collected both at baseline and after an exercise-induced PEM provocation to capture changes in real-time.

## What has been found?

The researchers identified a unique subpopulation of classical monocytes characterized by reduced CD14 accessibility and increased accessibility near pro-inflammatory genes. These specific genes were found to be significantly upregulated in ME/CFS patients. Additionally, the study observed widespread epigenetic reprogramming at transcription factor binding sites, particularly involving the NF-kappa-B (NF-κB) family in monocytes.

## Discussion

The findings suggest that ME/CFS is characterized by a persistent state of monocyte activation that is etched into the cells' epigenome. This epigenetic 'priming' likely explains why patients react so strongly to physical exertion.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The discovery of a distinct, inflammatory monocyte subset provides a new biomarker for ME/CFS pathology. Future research should focus on whether these epigenetic changes can be reversed to alleviate systemic inflammation.

## Summary

Dr. Jarred Younger proposes a novel treatment called Dextro-Naltrexone to fix the "brain inflammation" believed to cause ME/CFS. He explains that standard Naltrexone (used in LDN) contains two parts: one that helps inflammation (Dextro) and one that blocks endorphins (Levo). The "Levo" part limits how much medicine a patient can take. By isolating and using *only* the **Dextro-Naltrexone** 💊, patients could potentially take much stronger doses to turn off brain inflammation without blocking their natural painkillers. Since drug companies won't make it due to profit issues, Dr. Younger is manufacturing it himself to run the first clinical trials.

Dr. Jarred Younger is investigating **Dextro-Naltrexone** (D-Naltrexone), a specific form of the drug naltrexone, as a targeted treatment for brain inflammation (neuroinflammation). He hypothesizes that this drug can treat the root cause of symptoms in ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, and Long COVID by calming overactive brain immune cells (microglia) without the side effects associated with current naltrexone treatments.

## Why was it researched?

Current treatments like **Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)** 💊 help many patients but have a "therapeutic ceiling." Standard naltrexone is a mixture of two mirror-image molecules: *Levo-naltrexone* (which blocks opioid receptors) and *Dextro-naltrexone* (which reduces inflammation). Because the *Levo* component blocks natural endorphins, the dose cannot be raised high enough to fully suppress inflammation without causing severe side effects (like pain sensitivity or depression). Dr. Younger aims to isolate the *Dextro* component to create a drug that targets inflammation exclusively, allowing for much higher, more effective dosing.

## How was it researched?

This is an ongoing translational research project. Dr. Younger has identified that D-Naltrexone acts as a **Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist**. TLR4 is the primary "switch" that activates microglia (brain immune cells). Since pharmaceutical companies have declined to develop this drug due to low profit potential (it is an unpatentable natural isomer), Dr. Younger's lab has taken on the role of the manufacturer. They are currently raising funds to synthesize the pure drug, filing an **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application with the FDA, and designing the first human clinical trials to test its safety and efficacy.

## What has been found?

- **The Glia Theory:** Dr. Younger explains that in ME/CFS, the brain's immune cells (**microglia**) are "primed" or stuck in a hyperactive state. Instead of protecting the brain, they constantly release inflammatory chemicals (cytokines) that cause "sickness behavior"—the feeling of severe fatigue, brain fog, and widespread pain.
  - **The Dextro-Naltrexone Solution:** In pre-clinical models, D-Naltrexone successfully shuts down this microglial activation by blocking TLR4 receptors. Unlike regular naltrexone, it has **zero interaction with opioid receptors**. This means it does not block pain-relieving endorphins, theoretically allowing patients to take doses 10x to 20x higher than LDN to aggressively crush brain inflammation without side effects.

## Discussion

Dr. Younger highlights a major systemic failure in drug development known as the "Valley of Death," where promising treatments for chronic illnesses fail to reach patients because they are not profitable for Big Pharma. Because D-Naltrexone is an isomer of an old drug, it cannot be easily patented. Consequently, no drug company will invest the millions needed for clinical trials. Dr. Younger argues that academic labs must step in to bridge this gap. He also notes that while LDN is a helpful tool, it is likely only scratching the surface of what naltrexone can do; the "dextro" side is doing the healing, while the "levo" side is limiting the dose.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Dr. Younger concludes that Dextro-Naltrexone represents one of the most promising targeted therapies for neuroinflammation-driven fatigue and pain. His lab is currently finalizing the manufacturing protocol and preparing for the regulatory hurdles of the FDA. The immediate next step is securing sufficient funding (via donations and grants) to pay for the synthesis of the clinical-grade drug and the subsequent human safety trials.

## Summary

This study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 infection can leave a measurable, lasting imprint on the brain's structure and chemistry, even in individuals who consider themselves fully recovered. By identifying specific markers of altered myelin and tissue microstructure that correlate with symptom severity, the research provides a biological framework for understanding the persistent cognitive and physical challenges associated with Long COVID. These findings highlight the potential for long-term neurological consequences in the wider population post-infection.

## What was researched?

The study investigated potential long-term alterations in brain tissue microstructure, myelin signal intensity, and neurochemical levels in individuals with Long COVID compared to those who recovered from COVID-19 and uninfected healthy controls.

## Why was it researched?

While many COVID-19 survivors experience lingering neurological symptoms, the underlying biological changes in the brain for both symptomatic patients and those who appear to have recovered are not yet fully understood.

## How was it researched?

Researchers used advanced 3T multimodal MRI techniques, including T1w/T2w mapping for myelin, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for microstructure, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for neurochemicals. The cohort included 19 Long COVID patients, 12 recovered individuals without symptoms, and 16 healthy controls who had never been infected.

## What has been found?

Significant alterations in brain signal intensity and tissue microstructure were found in both the Long COVID and recovered groups compared to uninfected controls. Changes in the T1w/T2w signal, which relates to myelin integrity, were significantly correlated with physical and cognitive function scores. Notably, unique neurochemical profile differences were identified specifically in the Long COVID group when compared to the recovered-healthy group.

## Discussion

The findings suggest that the virus may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health even in the absence of active symptoms. A limitation of the study is the small sample size, which may affect the generalizability of the neurochemical findings across larger populations.

## Conclusion & Future Work

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to measurable neurological changes that persist beyond the acute phase of the illness, regardless of whether a patient reports ongoing symptoms. Further longitudinal research is required to determine if these brain alterations are permanent or if they resolve over time.

## Summary

This research provides a direct molecular explanation for the 'fibrinaloids' or microclots found in Long COVID and ME/CFS patients. By demonstrating that specific fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein create clots that are physically resistant to the body's natural breakdown mechanisms, the study validates a major theory of the disease's vascular pathology. These findings offer a potential diagnostic marker and suggest that treatments targeting these specific amyloid-protein interactions could help restore normal blood flow and reduce systemic symptoms. Overall, it identifies a clear mechanism for why viral remnants can cause long-term health issues long after the initial infection.

## What was researched?

This study investigated how specific amyloid-forming peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interact with and disrupt the human blood coagulation system.

## Why was it researched?

The researchers aimed to understand the molecular cause of 'fibrinaloids,' or amyloid microclots, which are thought to contribute to persistent inflammation and circulatory issues in patients suffering from post-viral conditions.

## How was it researched?

The team tested seven amyloidogenic Spike protein fragments in a controlled laboratory environment using purified clotting proteins. They monitored how these fragments affected the formation of fibrin clots and their subsequent breakdown after adding the enzyme activator tPA 💊.

## What has been found?

Two specific fragments, Spike601 and Spike685, were found to be highly active in disrupting the clotting process. Spike601 interfered with initial clot formation, while Spike685 caused the creation of dense, abnormal clot networks that were essentially immune to being dissolved by natural enzymatic processes.

## Discussion

While the study was limited to laboratory conditions using isolated components, it provides strong evidence for the amyloid-microclot hypothesis. The identification of specific 'active' peptides offers a focused pathway for future clinical research into treating the vascular symptoms of Long COVID and ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that specific Spike protein amyloid fibrils can directly cause the formation of lysis-resistant microclots. These results explain how viral proteins could contribute to the systemic vascular pathology observed in persistent post-viral diseases.

## Summary

This study protocol marks a shift in research toward finding safer, home-based ways for ME/CFS and Long COVID patients to manage their symptoms. By testing "conscious movement"—which teaches patients to listen closely to their body's limits—scientists hope to find a way to maintain physical activity without the high risk of post-exertional malaise often caused by standard exercise. If successful, this research could validate a new, telehealth-accessible treatment model that emphasizes safety and pacing over "pushing through" fatigue. It represents an important step in acknowledging the unique physiological constraints of these conditions while still seeking ways to improve patients' quality of life.

## What was researched?

This protocol outlines a clinical trial designed to compare the safety and effectiveness of a "conscious movement" telerehabilitation program against standard low-intensity exercise and usual care. The research focuses on individuals living with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) or Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), aiming to determine if a mindfulness-based approach can improve fatigue and physical function without triggering symptom worsening.

## Why was it researched?

Conventional rehabilitation and exercise programs have frequently led to patient dissatisfaction and adverse events, specifically post-exertional malaise (PEM), in the ME/CFS community. Researchers recognized a critical need for safer clinical approaches that prioritize pacing and body awareness. This study seeks to fill the knowledge gap regarding whether integrating interoception—the ability to sense internal body signals—can help patients engage in movement more sustainably than traditional low-intensity exercise.

## How was it researched?

This is a prospective, single-blind, three-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 147 participants aged 18 to 70. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: conscious movement (mind-body exercise), low-intensity exercise, or usual care. The 12-week intervention will be delivered entirely via telehealth, featuring weekly 45-minute sessions and encouraged daily practice. The primary outcome will be measured using the Chalder Fatigue Scale, with secondary outcomes including heart rate variability (HRV), pain intensity, and sleep quality monitored at baseline, 12 weeks, and a 3-month follow-up.

## What has been found?

As this paper describes the study protocol, the final results are not yet available; however, the researchers have established a structured methodology focused on "symptom-titrated" movement. They hypothesize that the conscious movement group will show superior improvements in fatigue scores compared to the other groups. The study design specifically prioritizes safety monitoring for adverse events to provide evidence-based data on the feasibility of mindful movement for this patient population.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the hypothesis that "conscious movement" may provide greater benefits by modulating the immune system through both autonomic and cognitive activity. They highlight the potential for improved interoception to help patients make real-time adjustments to their activity levels, thereby reducing the risk of "crashing." Acknowledged limitations include the potential for patient drop-out due to the long duration of the intervention and the subjective nature of self-reported fatigue metrics.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that this trial will provide essential data on whether mindful, interoceptive movement can serve as a safe and effective rehabilitation strategy. Future work will involve analyzing the 3-month follow-up data to see if the benefits of the program are maintained over time. The ultimate goal is to refine personalized rehabilitation strategies that can be integrated into standard clinical care for ME/CFS and Long COVID.

## Summary

This research introduces a compelling model that views ME/CFS as a "waste management" problem within the brain. It suggests that the profound fatigue and "brain fog" reported by patients are not just subjective feelings but may be the result of a physical accumulation of metabolic toxins that the brain is unable to wash away. By identifying the glymphatic system as a key player, this study provides a potential bridge between known issues like low blood flow and neuroinflammation. While more clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings, the focus on brain clearance opens a new frontier for developing objective tests and treatments aimed at restoring the brain's natural cleaning process.

## What was researched?

This paper explored the hypothesis that dysregulation of the glymphatic system—the brain's specialized waste-clearance mechanism—is a central factor in the development and symptoms of ME/CFS. The researchers investigated how a failure in "cleaning" metabolic toxins from the central nervous system could explain the complex and diverse symptoms experienced by patients.

## Why was it researched?

Despite decades of study, ME/CFS lacks a definitive cause or a standard objective diagnostic test. Because the glymphatic system is primarily active during sleep to remove neurotoxic waste and has already been linked to other neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s, the authors proposed that "clogging" of this system might be the missing link that connects hallmark symptoms like brain fog, sleep disturbances, and post-exertional malaise.

## How was it researched?

This was a comprehensive literature review and theoretical analysis that synthesized recent findings in neurobiology, immunology, and ME/CFS research. The authors analyzed evidence regarding cerebral blood flow, neuroinflammation, and the role of AQP4 water channels, which are critical for glymphatic flow. They integrated data from diverse areas, including gut-brain axis studies, oxidative stress research, and vascular dysfunction, to propose a unified model of how these factors converge to cause glymphatic system dysfunction (GD).

## What has been found?

The study proposes that glymphatic dysfunction is a major contributor to ME/CFS pathophysiology, suggesting that symptoms arise when the brain cannot effectively clear out metabolic byproducts like lactic acid. The authors identified several potential drivers of this dysfunction, including impaired cerebral blood flow (hypoxia), neuroinflammation, and the possible presence of autoantibodies targeting AQP4 water channels. They also highlighted how sleep disturbances create a "vicious cycle," where poor sleep prevents the glymphatic system from clearing waste, which in turn further disrupts sleep and cognitive function.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the significant overlap between ME/CFS and Long COVID, noting that glymphatic impairment may be a shared mechanism in both conditions. They acknowledge that while the evidence for glymphatic involvement is strong based on existing data, direct clinical proof in ME/CFS cohorts—such as specialized neuroimaging—is still in its early stages. A primary limitation is the current difficulty in non-invasively measuring glymphatic flow in humans, which has historically hindered research in this area.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The paper concludes that glymphatic system dysregulation offers a cohesive explanation for the multi-systemic nature of ME/CFS. The authors call for future research to prioritize the development of glymphatic-specific biomarkers and the use of advanced MRI techniques to visualize fluid movement in the brains of patients. They suggest that exploring treatments to enhance glymphatic drainage, such as vagus nerve stimulation 💊 or manual lymphatic therapies, could lead to much-needed breakthroughs in patient care.

## Summary

This research is significant because it provides some of the first large-scale evidence that the metabolic "brokenness" often felt by ME/CFS patients is tied to their genetic makeup. By identifying specific genes like *HSD11B1*, which is involved in processing the stress hormone cortisol, the study validates long-standing theories about the role of the HPA axis in this illness. While it does not point to a single "cause," it suggests that many tiny genetic differences combine to disrupt how the body handles energy and inflammation. This objective data helps move the field toward better patient subtyping and identifies new biological targets for future drug development focused on metabolism and the hormonal system.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to determine if there is a genetic reason for the metabolic abnormalities—specifically differences in blood chemicals and fats—observed in people with ME/CFS. The researchers performed a metabolite genome-wide association study (mGWAS) to find links between specific DNA variations and the levels of 135 different metabolic markers in the blood.

## Why was it researched?

While many studies have identified metabolic "perturbations" or imbalances in ME/CFS patients, it has remained unclear whether these changes are caused by genetics, environment, or the disease process itself. By using a massive database like the UK Biobank, the researchers sought to identify "typos" in the genetic code (SNPs) that might predispose individuals to the metabolic and neuroendocrine dysfunction characteristic of the illness.

## How was it researched?

This was a large-scale genetic and metabolic data analysis comparing 875 ME/CFS patients with 36,033 healthy controls from the UK Biobank cohort. The team analyzed 135 metabolic biomarkers measured via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, including various cholesterol particles (lipoproteins), fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites. They used statistical modeling to identify genetic variants that influenced these metabolite levels differently in the patient group compared to the healthy group.

## What has been found?

The study identified 112 significant genetic-metabolic associations unique to the ME/CFS group, highlighting two specific markers—*HSD11B1* and *SCGN*—that are linked to the body’s stress-response system (the HPA axis) and fat metabolism. Variants in *HSD11B1* were specifically associated with changes in phospholipids within very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), while variants in *SCGN* affected total fatty acid levels. Additionally, the researchers found that genetic effects on immune-related pathways (involving genes like *ADAP1*, *NR1H3*, and *CD40*) differed between patients and controls, suggesting a combined disruption of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neurotransmitter transport.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that these findings provide a "molecular rationale" for the diversity of symptoms seen in patients, suggesting that ME/CFS is likely a polygenic condition driven by many small-effect genetic variants. They acknowledge a significant limitation: the UK Biobank relies on self-reported diagnoses, which could lead to the inclusion of misdiagnosed individuals. They also noted that the ME/CFS group had higher rates of high cholesterol and blood pressure medication use compared to the exceptionally healthy control group, which could influence metabolic readings.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that there is a measurable genetic predisposition to metabolic and neuroendocrine abnormalities in ME/CFS, particularly involving how the body regulates cortisol and fats. They suggest that future research should focus on tissue-specific studies—such as looking directly at liver or fat tissue—to better understand how these genes disrupt local cortisol regeneration.

## Summary

This research is significant for ME/CFS patients because it scientifically validates the illness as part of a recognized cluster of serious, multisystemic conditions alongside established diseases like Multiple Sclerosis. By highlighting the biological similarities between these conditions, the paper provides a strong argument for shifting away from the current "siloed" medical approach toward an integrated system of care. For patients, this could mean that the comprehensive support, financial aid, and specialized clinics currently available for MS serve as a blueprint for future ME/CFS healthcare reforms, potentially reducing the diagnostic struggle and improving access to social services.

## What was researched?

This study compared the clinical and biological features of several complex chronic conditions, including Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Long COVID, Fibromyalgia, Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The researchers analyzed the overlapping symptoms and underlying physiological changes of these illnesses while also evaluating how current health policies and social services support those affected.

## Why was it researched?

Despite being distinct diagnoses, these conditions share significant physiological features—such as immune dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities—that often lead to diagnostic confusion and mismanagement. The researchers aimed to address the "siloed" nature of current medical care and point out that existing public health policies are insufficient, frequently resulting in lifelong social isolation and a lack of access to essential support for patients.

## How was it researched?

This was a comprehensive literature review and comparative analysis that synthesized existing clinical data and social policy frameworks. The authors examined the pathophysiology of each condition, focusing on immunological function, neurological regulation, and metabolism, and reviewed the management strategies used for each. They specifically used the well-established care and support model for Multiple Sclerosis as a benchmark to identify gaps in the management of other chronic fatigue conditions.

## What has been found?

The review identified that these conditions share a common disruption in the "gut-immune-brain axis," yet they are treated as entirely separate entities by health systems. For Multiple Sclerosis, clear pathways and treatments like steroids 💊 and disease-modifying therapies 💊 exist to improve patient outcomes. In contrast, while some patients with ME/CFS or Long COVID may find relief through autonomic modulators 💊 for co-occurring POTS or CNS stimulants 💊 for cognitive issues, there are no universally approved cures. The study found that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID face significantly higher systemic barriers to healthcare, financial assistance, and employment compared to those with better-recognized conditions.

## Discussion

The authors argue that managing these related conditions in isolation is inefficient and hinders the development of broader therapeutic strategies that could benefit multiple patient groups. They note that a major limitation for ME/CFS and Long COVID is the continued lack of an accessible molecular diagnostic test, which complicates the clinical recognition required for social support. However, they highlight that the existing care model for Multiple Sclerosis proves that structured, multidisciplinary support is possible for complex chronic illnesses.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a paradigm shift toward integrated research and coordinated public health policy is necessary to improve the quality of life for all affected patients. They suggest that future work should focus on sharing collective knowledge across these disease communities to create unified care pathways and more effective, shared therapeutic options.

## Summary

This research identifies a specific physical abnormality in the brain's wiring that correlates directly with the severity of fatigue in ME/CFS. By pinpointing localized damage in the cingulum bundle, the study moves away from vague "functional" explanations toward a more concrete, structural understanding of the disease. The high diagnostic accuracy (85%) of the identified white matter markers suggests we are closer to having objective MRI-based tools for confirming an ME/CFS diagnosis. Importantly, the link between structural recovery and symptom improvement offers a more optimistic view of the brain's ability to heal if the right therapeutic interventions are identified.

## What was researched?

This study investigated microstructural changes in the brain's "white matter"—the wiring that connects different brain regions—in individuals with ME/CFS. Specifically, the researchers looked for "segmental injuries" within the cingulum bundle, a critical neural pathway involved in emotion, motivation, and cognitive processing.

## Why was it researched?

While ME/CFS is widely recognized as involving the central nervous system, previous neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results regarding exactly which brain structures are affected. The researchers aimed to provide more clarity by using high-resolution imaging and a large patient group to see if specific, localized disruptions in white matter tracts could explain the persistent fatigue experienced by patients.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a large-scale study involving 100 patients with ME/CFS and 100 healthy controls. They utilized Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), a specialized MRI technique that measures the movement of water molecules to assess the integrity of white matter fibers. The team analyzed 87 different white matter tract templates and applied machine learning algorithms to determine if these brain measurements could accurately identify patients. They also performed a "causal analysis" to see if improvements in fatigue symptoms following treatment were linked to the repair of these specific brain structures.

## What has been found?

The study found significant impairments (reduced fractional anisotropy) in specific sections of the left cingulum bundle, namely the parolfactory and frontal-parahippocampal tracts. These disruptions were localized to the middle-posterior portion of the bundle, suggesting a "segmental injury" rather than a total breakdown of the fiber. Using these specific white matter markers, a machine learning model was able to distinguish ME/CFS patients from healthy individuals with 85% accuracy. Furthermore, the researchers observed that when patients’ fatigue symptoms improved after clinical intervention, there was a measurable recovery in the structural integrity of these same white matter segments.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the cingulum bundle as a "pivotal" structure in ME/CFS, noting its role in the communication between the limbic system (emotions) and the frontal cortex (executive function). They suggest that the localized nature of the injury might explain why standard brain scans often appear normal. While the sample size is notably large for an MRI study, the authors emphasize that these microstructural changes should be further validated across diverse patient populations to ensure the findings are universal.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that segmental injury to the cingulum bundle is a key pathological feature of ME/CFS and a highly promising objective biomarker for the disease. Future research will likely focus on why these specific segments are vulnerable and whether targeted therapies can more effectively promote the "recovery" of these neural pathways to alleviate symptoms.

## Summary

This research identifies a measurable biological link between persistent fatigue and the immune system in patients who have technically "recovered" from sarcoidosis. By demonstrating that markers like IL-6 and hsCRP remain elevated in fatigued patients, the study provides a potential explanation for why symptoms persist after the primary disease is in remission. This aligns the pathology of post-sarcoidosis fatigue with other chronic fatigue conditions like ME/CFS and Long COVID, suggesting that low-grade inflammation is a shared driver. For patients, these results offer validation that their symptoms have an organic, measurable basis, though further clinical trials are needed before these markers can be used to guide specific treatment protocols.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether the persistent fatigue and depressive symptoms experienced by sarcoidosis patients in remission are linked to lingering systemic inflammation or oxidative stress. The researchers sought to identify specific peripheral biomarkers that could distinguish between patients who recover fully and those who develop a post-sarcoidosis chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Why was it researched?

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that often leaves patients with debilitating fatigue (affecting up to 70% of individuals) even after the primary condition has entered remission. The biological mechanisms behind this persistent exhaustion are poorly understood, making it difficult to diagnose or treat. Researchers hypothesized that shared inflammatory pathways—similar to those seen in ME/CFS and Long COVID—might be responsible for these ongoing symptoms.

## How was it researched?

This was a comparative cross-sectional study involving 71 patients with sarcoidosis. The participants were divided into three groups: those in remission with significant fatigue (RS/CFS), those in remission without fatigue (R/S), and those with active disease (A/S). The team used validated scales (FAS, BDI, and PHQ-9) to assess fatigue, depression, and quality of life, alongside pulmonary function tests. Blood samples were analyzed via ELISA to measure levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and markers of oxidative stress such as total antioxidant status and 8-isoprostanes.

## What has been found?

The study found that patients suffering from fatigue (both in the active and remission groups) had significantly higher blood levels of hsCRP and IL-6 compared to those in remission without fatigue. Specifically, IL-6 levels were found to correlate moderately with the severity of both fatigue and depressive symptoms. Conversely, no significant differences were found in TNF-α levels or oxidative stress markers between the groups. While lung function was slightly reduced in fatigued patients, it only weakly explained the mental aspects of their fatigue, suggesting the symptoms are driven more by biochemical factors than physical lung capacity.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how these findings support the "low-grade inflammation" hypothesis, where residual immune activity continues to affect the central nervous system even after the main granulomatous disease is controlled. They note that the correlation between IL-6 and mood symptoms suggests a common immune-metabolic pathway for both fatigue and depression in this population. A potential limitation mentioned is the need for larger, more diverse cohorts to confirm these biomarkers across different stages of the disease.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that low-grade systemic inflammation, specifically involving elevated hsCRP and IL-6, plays a key role in the persistence of fatigue during sarcoidosis remission. They suggest that IL-6 could serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying and monitoring this condition. Future research should focus on integrating these inflammatory findings with metabolic and neuroendocrine data to develop targeted interventions for patients.

## Summary

This research is significant for the ME/CFS community as it provides clear evidence that the illness is not a random outcome but often follows a predictable pattern of severe acute symptoms in young people. By establishing that factors like "brain fog" and dizziness during the initial infection are major risk markers, the study supports the need for early medical recognition rather than a "wait and see" approach. These findings may help patients and families advocate for earlier support and could eventually lead to targeted trials for those most likely to remain chronically ill.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to identify specific factors during the initial (acute) phase of a COVID-19 infection that could predict which children and young people are most likely to develop severe long-term illness. Specifically, the researchers looked for indicators that lead to severe Post-COVID Condition (PCC) and the development of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

## Why was it researched?

While Post-COVID Condition is recognized as a significant health burden in younger populations, there has been a lack of evidence regarding which early symptoms signal a high risk for severe outcomes. Identifying these predictors early is essential for clinicians to provide timely interventions and appropriate care pathways, especially for those at risk of the most debilitating forms of the disease.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted an observational registry study at a specialized pediatric hospital in Munich, Germany, involving 120 participants aged 7 to 25 years who were diagnosed with PCC. They utilized standardized assessment tools, including the novel Munich Long COVID Symptom Questionnaire (MLCSQ), to track symptom progression from the acute infection through the chronic phase. Severity was determined using several established scales for fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, and physical function, while ME/CFS was diagnosed according to established clinical criteria.

## What has been found?

The study found that a high number of symptoms during the initial infection (12 or more), female sex, and specific acute symptoms like orthostatic intolerance (dizziness upon standing) and concentration difficulties were strong predictors of severe long-term illness. Specifically, 24% of the participants were diagnosed with ME/CFS, all of whom belonged to the "severe" group characterized by high symptom complexity and poor physical function. A threshold of 12 or more acute symptoms was identified as a highly specific indicator for those likely to require intensive monitoring.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that the study's monocentric design (conducted at a single hospital) and its nature as a registry study may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population. However, they emphasize that this is the first systematic investigation to successfully link acute-phase symptoms to severe PCC and ME/CFS in children and young people, providing a valuable framework for risk stratification.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the complexity and type of symptoms present during the very first weeks of infection serve as early warning signs for severe chronic illness and ME/CFS. They suggest that future research and clinical management should focus on integrating ME/CFS expertise into standard pediatric care for those identified as high-risk early on.

## Summary

This landmark study provides robust evidence that ME/CFS is a biological illness with a deep-seated genetic foundation, potentially silencing long-standing debates about its origins. By identifying over 22,000 genetic combinations, it explains the extreme variety of symptoms seen in patients and shifts the focus toward "stratified medicine," where treatments are tailored to a patient's specific genetic profile. The significant overlap with Long COVID is particularly promising, as it suggests that research and potential treatments for one condition may directly benefit the other, accelerating the search for effective therapies. While the study indicates that one "cure-all" drug is unlikely, it opens the door for a more precise, personalized approach to managing the disease.

## What was researched?

This study utilized advanced combinatorial genetic analysis to identify specific sets of genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS). The researchers also compared these genetic risk factors with those previously identified in Long COVID to determine the biological commonalities between the two conditions.

## Why was it researched?

Previous genetic research into ME/CFS using traditional methods has struggled to find reproducible results, largely because the disease is highly complex and affects multiple body systems. By moving beyond looking at single genes in isolation, this study aimed to uncover the complex "signatures" of combined genes that drive the disease, which could lead to better diagnostic tools and personalized treatments.

## How was it researched?

The researchers applied the PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform to analyze genomic data from 14,767 participants in the DecodeME cohort and compared them to healthy controls from the UK Biobank. The study searched for combinations of 1 to 4 genetic variants (SNPs) that were significantly more frequent in ME/CFS patients across three independent patient groups to ensure reproducibility. They then mapped these variants to specific genes and compared 180 genes previously linked to Long COVID with the new ME/CFS findings.

## What has been found?

The analysis identified 22,411 reproducible genetic signatures involving 2,311 unique genes that are consistently associated with ME/CFS. Individuals with the highest number of these signatures were 1.64 times more likely to have the disease than those with the lowest count. The study highlighted 259 "core" genes linked to four primary disease mechanisms: neurological dysregulation, inflammation, cellular stress responses, and calcium signaling. Furthermore, 76 of the 180 genes previously linked to Long COVID were found to be shared with ME/CFS, suggesting a significant but partial overlap in the underlying biology of the two illnesses.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the limitations of the study, noting that it is currently a preprint and has not yet undergone peer review. They acknowledge that while the large DecodeME cohort provides significant power, the study relies on self-reported data and questionnaires, though these were validated against clinical diagnostic criteria. They emphasize that the findings prove ME/CFS is a polygenic and highly diverse condition, meaning no single drug is likely to help every patient.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that ME/CFS has a clear, multisystemic genetic basis, which provides the foundation for future clinical trials. They identified dozens of "drug repurposing" opportunities—existing medications that target the newly discovered pathways—and plan to explore how these can be used to treat specific patient subgroups. Future work will focus on developing biomarker-led trials to match patients with the treatments most likely to address their specific biological drivers.

## Summary

This research provides evidence that Gulf War Illness involves measurable changes in how the immune system functions at a genetic level, many of which overlap with observations in other chronic fatiguing illnesses like ME/CFS. By identifying 33 specific genes that are "switched on or off" differently in patients, the study moves closer to finding an objective biological signature for a condition that has long been difficult to diagnose. While the results are preliminary due to the small cohort, they suggest that chronic inflammation and metabolic stress are core features of the illness, potentially opening the door for future diagnostic tests and therapies aimed at regulating these immune pathways.

## What was researched?

This study investigated changes in the gene expression (transcriptomics) of immune cells in Australian veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Researchers analyzed a specific panel of 785 genes related to immune exhaustion and inflammation to identify potential biological markers for the disease.

## Why was it researched?

Gulf War Illness is a chronic condition affecting approximately one-third of Gulf War veterans, characterized by symptoms like chronic fatigue and brain fog. Despite its prevalence, the biological cause remains elusive, though it is strongly linked to toxic environmental exposures. This research aimed to fill a knowledge gap regarding the specific immune signaling pathways and genetic signatures that may drive the illness in Australian cohorts.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a laboratory analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 Australian GWI veterans and 15 healthy controls. Participants were sex-matched (all male) and diagnosed using the CDC and Kansas criteria. The team used NanoString technology to quantify the expression of hundreds of immune-related genes and applied pathway analysis to determine how these genetic changes affect cellular functions like stress response and inflammation.

## What has been found?

The study identified 33 genes that were expressed differently in GWI patients compared to healthy individuals, with 21 genes being more active (upregulated) and 12 being less active (downregulated). Upregulated genes, such as SIGLEC1 and MMP9, were associated with metabolic stress and cellular defense, while downregulated genes, including IL7 and various T cell receptors, suggested a weakened adaptive immune response. These findings point to chronic inflammation and specific disturbances in interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways.

## Discussion

The authors noted that while specific markers of "immune exhaustion" did not differ statistically from controls, the overall genetic patterns suggest a state of chronic immune activation and cellular stress. They emphasize that the identified changes in neutrophil signaling and lipid-related pathways provide a clearer map of the inflammation present in GWI. A primary limitation acknowledged is the small sample size, which requires larger-scale studies to confirm these markers.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The investigation concludes that GWI is characterized by significant immune dysregulation, particularly involving pathways that control how the body responds to infections and stress. The researchers suggest that the identified genetic markers could eventually be used for diagnostic screening or as targets for new treatments. Future work will focus on validating these findings in a larger, more diverse group of patients to improve the accuracy of GWI detection.

## Summary

This research serves as a high-level validation of the biological reality of ME/CFS by placing it within a century-long history of post-infectious syndromes. It suggests that the massive global effort currently directed at Long COVID is finally generating the data and scientific tools—such as advanced immune profiling—needed to understand why some people do not recover after an illness. For patients currently living with ME/CFS, this paper indicates a shift in the scientific community toward viewing these conditions as systemic biological disorders rather than psychological ones, potentially accelerating the path toward objective diagnostics and targeted therapies.

## What was researched?

This paper examined the history and biological patterns of Post-Acute Infection Syndromes (PAIS), which are chronic illnesses that develop following an acute infection. The researchers focused on connecting well-known conditions like myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID to a broader historical context of similar syndromes triggered by various pathogens over the last century.

## Why was it researched?

While Long COVID has recently brought global attention to post-infectious illness, ME/CFS and other related conditions have existed for decades with limited recognition and research funding. The authors aimed to demonstrate that these syndromes are a recurring consequence of epidemics and that the current "Long COVID era" provides a unique, high-tech opportunity to solve the biological mysteries that have historically left ME/CFS patients without clear answers.

## How was it researched?

The authors conducted a comprehensive review of historical medical literature and contemporary scientific data regarding post-acute sequelae. They synthesized evidence from multiple infectious triggers—including influenza, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and *Borrelia burgdorferi* (Lyme disease)—and compared their clinical presentations and immunological profiles to Long COVID. The analysis specifically focused on common themes such as immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and the historical dismissal of these patients by the medical establishment.

## What has been found?

The review finds that PAIS are not new or unique to COVID-19; rather, they have been documented for over 100 years following various viral, bacterial, and parasitic outbreaks. Despite different initial triggers, these conditions often share a "common core" of symptoms, including profound fatigue and cognitive impairment, and exhibit overlapping biological signatures like persistent inflammation and altered immune cell behavior. The authors also highlight how the lack of visible biomarkers has historically led to the "psychologization" of these illnesses, particularly in the case of ME/CFS.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the significant knowledge gaps that persist due to a historical lack of systematic investigation into post-infectious chronic illness. They emphasize that while the scale of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unprecedented, the biological pathways involved likely represent a general host response to infection that can go awry. A major limitation noted is the difficulty in diagnosing these conditions in the past due to a reliance on static measurements rather than advanced, dynamic immunological profiling.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that defining the specific biology of Long COVID will likely provide a breakthrough "blueprint" for understanding ME/CFS and other post-acute infection syndromes. They call for an integrated research approach that uses modern "omics" technologies to identify diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research must focus on how different pathogens can trigger similar chronic immune dysfunctions to finally develop effective treatments for all PAIS.

## Summary

This study provides high-volume evidence supporting the theory that COVID-19 can leave the immune system in a weakened state for nearly two years. For patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID, this research is significant because it identifies a clear, measurable biological abnormality—low lymphocyte counts—that aligns with symptoms of chronic fatigue and increased susceptibility to other infections. The finding that heart disease patients are particularly affected suggests that pre-existing health issues may compound the immune damage caused by the virus. While more work is needed to see if this "immune scar" is permanent, the study offers a concrete marker that could eventually help in diagnosing post-viral conditions or measuring the success of future immune-restoring treatments.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether key immune cells, known as lymphocyte subsets (including T cells, B cells, and NK cells), remain depleted in the blood long after the initial phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researchers tracked these levels over 20 months to see if a mass infection wave causes a temporary dip or a lasting "scar" on the human immune system.

## Why was it researched?

It is well-established that lymphocytes drop significantly during the acute phase of COVID-19, but there has been conflicting evidence regarding how quickly these levels recover. With millions of people suffering from Long COVID, scientists wanted to determine if persistent immune cell depletion could be a biological driver of chronic symptoms and whether certain groups, such as those with heart disease, are more vulnerable to long-term immune compromise.

## How was it researched?

This was a large-scale retrospective cohort study that analyzed laboratory data from 40,537 individuals at a major hospital in China. The researchers compared lymphocyte counts across three timeframes: a pre-COVID baseline (January 2021 – November 2022), a mass infection period (December 2022 – February 2023), and a post-COVID follow-up period (March 2023 – August 2024). They used statistical modeling to track immune recovery over 20 months and conducted specialized subgroup analyses for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD).

## What has been found?

The study found that a single wave of mass infection led to a significant and persistent reduction in nearly all lymphocyte subsets. Even 20 months after the initial exposure, CD8+ T cells (which are critical for killing virally infected cells) remained 9.9% below their pre-pandemic baseline. The impact was most severe in patients with cardiovascular disease, whose total T-cell counts dropped by 72.9% and showed almost no signs of recovery over the two-year period. Furthermore, the study noted that males and older adults experienced significantly slower immune restoration compared to other groups.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that these findings redefine SARS-CoV-2 as a condition that can induce a state of "long-lasting immune compromise" in a significant portion of the population. They discuss potential causes, such as the virus persisting in tissues or causing exhaustion in the bone marrow where these cells are produced. A noted limitation is that the data comes from patients who visited a hospital, which might not perfectly represent the entire healthy population, and some critics have pointed out that while the drops are statistically significant, many patients' counts may still fall within the broad "normal" clinical range.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that the sustained reduction in lymphocytes is a key immunologic feature of the post-COVID landscape and may contribute to the pathogenesis of Long COVID. They call for personalized clinical care for those showing persistent lymphopenia, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Future research is needed to determine if these immune changes eventually reverse on their own or if specific immunotherapies are required to help the body rebuild its defenses.

## Summary

This study provides strong evidence that ME/CFS and Long COVID are biologically very similar, which validates the experiences of many patients who found their symptoms mirrored across the two conditions. The finding of a "shared signature" of low antiviral immune cells and high inflammation suggests that research progress in one field will likely accelerate progress in the other. For patients, this could mean that diagnostic tools or treatments currently being developed for Long COVID may eventually be applicable to ME/CFS as well. While the study is a significant step in mapping the immune landscape of these illnesses, further research is needed to determine the exact cause of these shared immune changes.

## What was researched?

This study aimed to compare the immune systems of patients diagnosed with ME/CFS and those with Long COVID (specifically post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they share common biological markers. Researchers analyzed specific immune cell subsets and various inflammatory signals (cytokines) to see if these two conditions are immunologically distinct or essentially the same.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS and Long COVID share a high degree of clinical overlap, including symptoms like profound fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM), leading many to hypothesize they may share the same underlying disease mechanisms. However, most previous studies have looked at these conditions in isolation. This research was prompted by the need for direct comparative data to understand if the immune dysfunction seen in both groups is truly comparable.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study involving 190 participants, divided into three groups: 65 patients with ME/CFS, 54 patients with Long COVID, and 70 healthy controls. They utilized flow cytometry to measure levels of various immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and analyzed blood samples for levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Statistical analyses were used to compare these markers between the three groups and to correlate them with the patients' psychological and physical fatigue levels.

## What has been found?

The study found that patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit nearly identical immune profiles, with no significant differences found between the two patient groups in any of the tested biomarkers. Both conditions showed significantly lower levels of total lymphocytes, CD8+ "killer" T cells, and NK cells compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, both groups demonstrated significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF, and elevated levels of regulatory cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how the reduction in NK cells and CD8+ T cells suggests a weakened immune defense against viruses and tumors in both conditions. They highlight that the chronic inflammatory state, marked by elevated IL-6 and TNF, likely contributes to the persistent fatigue and multisystemic symptoms reported by patients. The authors note that the lack of biological distinction between the two groups supports the idea that ME/CFS and Long COVID may be different names for a similar post-viral inflammatory syndrome.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS and Long COVID are characterized by comparable immune alterations and inflammatory signatures, suggesting a shared immunopathological basis. They recommend that future research should focus on longitudinal studies to track how these immune markers change over time and to explore whether unified therapeutic strategies could benefit both patient populations.

## Summary

This report signifies a major turning point in the systemic recognition and funding of ME/CFS and Long COVID. By dedicating half a billion euros over ten years, the German government is creating a stable environment for scientists to search for biological causes rather than just managing symptoms. For patients, this means a higher likelihood of upcoming clinical trials and the potential discovery of objective biomarkers that could eventually lead to a definitive diagnostic blood test. While the road to a "cure" remains long, this level of investment is designed to bridge the gap between basic laboratory science and real-world clinical treatments.

## What was researched?

This news analysis examines the German government’s decision to commit €500 million ($582 million) to research post-infectious diseases. It explores whether this massive funding boost will be sufficient to discover effective treatments and diagnostic biomarkers for conditions like Long COVID and ME/CFS.

## Why was it researched?

Post-infectious syndromes have created a global health crisis, with Long COVID estimated to cost the world economy US$1 trillion annually. Despite the high prevalence—affecting nearly one in five people in Germany—there remains a critical lack of validated therapies and a "black box" regarding the underlying biological mechanisms, prompting the need for a large-scale, coordinated research "moonshot."

## How was it researched?

This was a news investigation and scientific policy analysis. The author synthesized data from recent epidemiological studies in Germany and the US, interviewed leading clinical epidemiologists and researchers (including Ziyad Al-Aly and Rafael Mikolajczyk), and reviewed the strategic framework of Germany's "National Decade Against Post-Infectious Diseases" (2026–2036).

## What has been found?

The German government has formally launched a 10-year initiative with a €500 million budget specifically targeting Long COVID, ME/CFS, and other post-viral conditions. The reporting highlights that an expert group has already identified four medications for prioritized off-label use evaluation to manage symptoms. Furthermore, the funding will support the National Clinical Study Group (NKSG) to accelerate clinical trials for promising candidates, such as the aptamer drug BC007 💊, which is currently being investigated for its potential to improve microcirculation.

## Discussion

The author notes that while €500 million is a substantial investment, it is not unlimited, as large-scale Phase III clinical trials can cost upwards of $50 million each. There is an ongoing debate within the scientific community and among patient advocates regarding whether the funds will prioritize biomedical research into viral persistence and autoimmunity or be diverted toward less effective biopsychosocial (psychological) models. A key strength identified is the multi-year commitment, which allows for longitudinal studies that are often missing in short-term funding cycles.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The article concludes that the funding represents a "great step in the right direction" and a significant political shift toward recognizing post-infectious diseases as a major public health priority. Future work will involve setting up the research infrastructure for the 2026–2036 decade, with a focus on standardizing metrics for economic and health impacts and conducting large-scale clinical trials.

## Summary

This review provides a vital update for patients and clinicians by validating ME/CFS as a biological, multisystemic illness. By explicitly stating that Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) should be avoided, it aligns with modern safety standards and protects patients from potential relapse. The research emphasizes that while we do not yet have a "cure," focusing on mitochondrial health and pacing can help manage the condition, and the strong link found between ME/CFS and Long COVID is likely to accelerate the development of new diagnostic tools.

## What was researched?

This comprehensive review systematically analyzed current diagnostic criteria, underlying biological mechanisms, and management strategies for ME/CFS. The researchers evaluated both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to provide updated clinical guidance, particularly in light of the overlap between ME/CFS and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (Long COVID).

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS has gained renewed scientific attention due to its rising global prevalence and its significant physiological similarities to Long COVID. Despite this, clinical guidance has historically been scarce or potentially harmful; therefore, this study aimed to synthesize recent advances in pathophysiology—such as neuroinflammation and mitochondrial issues—to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

## How was it researched?

The authors conducted a systematic literature review across major scientific databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. They analyzed studies published from the inception of the databases through August 2025, focusing on diagnostic frameworks, pathophysiological evidence, and the efficacy of various treatment modalities. The review included an assessment of standard clinical practices versus emerging biomedical interventions.

## What has been found?

The study confirmed that while definitive biomarkers are still lacking, diagnosis should rely on established clinical criteria focusing on post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction. Central pathologies were identified as immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Effective management strategies highlighted include activity pacing and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), while pharmacological approaches focus on mitochondrial support, antioxidant therapies, and immunomodulatory treatments. Importantly, the review found that Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) is contraindicated due to its potential to cause patient harm, and the experimental substance CP003 💊 is currently being evaluated for its safety and effectiveness in treating fatigue.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the ongoing challenge of diagnosing a condition that relies primarily on subjective symptom reports rather than objective blood tests. They highlight that while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be a helpful adjunctive tool for coping, it is not a curative treatment. A major point of discussion is the necessity of moving away from outdated "one-size-fits-all" exercise recommendations in favor of individualized, symptom-oriented care.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that ME/CFS is a complex multisystem disease requiring a multidisciplinary management approach that respects individual patient limits. Future research should prioritize the discovery of objective diagnostic biomarkers and the development of combination therapies that target multiple disease pathways simultaneously. The authors also suggest integrating digital health technologies to better monitor patient energy levels and symptoms in real-time.

## Summary

This research is significant because it provides objective biological evidence that ME/CFS is not a uniform condition, but rather one that may involve different immune system "stages" or drivers depending on the person's level of disability. By showing that severe patients have a distinct inflammatory signature compared to those with milder symptoms, the study opens the door for "stratified medicine," where treatments could be specifically targeted to a patient's immune profile. This could eventually lead to the development of a blood-based test that not only helps diagnose the condition but also helps doctors monitor how a patient is faring over time. While these results are promising, they represent an early step toward a validated diagnostic marker and require more extensive testing before they can be used in routine clinical practice.

## What was researched?

This study investigated whether specific immunological markers in the blood could distinguish between different levels of disease severity in individuals with ME/CFS. Specifically, researchers used flow cytometry to examine the activation and characteristics of "killer" immune cells—including CD8+ T cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells—to see if their profiles differed between mild/moderate and severe cases.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a complex disease where patients often experience varying degrees of disability, yet the biological reasons for these differences in severity are not well understood. While previous studies have identified immune system abnormalities, there has been a lack of clarity regarding whether specific immune signatures correlate with how severely a patient is affected. Identifying these differences is critical for developing better diagnostic tools and tailoring treatments to individual patient needs.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted an immunological analysis of blood samples from a cohort of 96 people living with ME/CFS, categorized into two groups: mild/moderate (n = 43) and severe (n = 53). Using flow cytometry, they measured various cellular markers of activation (such as CD69 and CD38), exhaustion, and "immunosenescence" (cell aging). They also stimulated the cells in a laboratory setting to observe the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-17. Statistical analyses were then performed to determine which immune features best discriminated between the two severity groups.

## What has been found?

The study found distinct immune "fingerprints" for different severity levels: patients with mild/moderate ME/CFS showed signs of "early-immunosenescence" (CD28-CD57- cells), which often indicates a response to a persistent viral infection. In contrast, patients with severe ME/CFS exhibited much higher levels of activated lymphocytes and a significantly greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a state of chronic, non-specific inflammation. These findings were consistent across several types of cytotoxic cells, and a combination of these markers was able to distinguish between the two patient groups with high statistical significance (AUC of 0.7843).

## Discussion

The authors note that the observed differences suggest that the underlying disease processes may shift as ME/CFS becomes more severe. They highlight that the markers identified have strong potential for use in clinical stratification—meaning they could help doctors categorize patients more accurately. A primary limitation mentioned is the need for further validation in larger, longitudinal studies that include healthy control groups to confirm if these signatures are unique to ME/CFS.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that symptom severity in ME/CFS is mirrored by specific, measurable changes in the immune system, particularly regarding how T cells and NK cells are activated. They suggest that the disease might involve different pathological mechanisms—such as viral persistence in milder cases versus chronic inflammation in severe cases. Future research will focus on verifying these markers in larger patient populations and investigating whether they can be used as prognostic tools to predict disease progression.

## Summary

This research identifies a clear biological signature of immune over-reactivity in Long COVID, demonstrating that patients' immune cells are 'primed' to over-produce interferon when they encounter viral signals. By linking this exaggerated response directly to the severity of patient fatigue, the findings validate patient experiences as a measurable consequence of immune dysregulation. This work provides a strong rationale for future clinical trials testing existing interferon-blocking medications to alleviate symptoms.

## What was researched?

The study investigated whether immune cells (PBMCs) from Long COVID patients exhibit a hyperresponsive type I interferon (IFN-I) response when exposed to synthetic viral mimics.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers sought to test if the chronic symptoms of Long COVID are driven by a 'trained' or hypersensitive immune system, potentially caused by lasting epigenetic changes following the initial infection.

## How was it researched?

The team collected immune cells from two distinct Long COVID cohorts and healthy controls, stimulating them with viral DNA/RNA mimics (G3-YSD and 3p-RNA) targeting the cGAS and RIG-I pathways. They then measured the resulting IFN-I bioactivity using a reporter cell line and assessed correlations with fatigue severity scores.

## What has been found?

Immune cells from Long COVID patients produced significantly more IFN-I bioactivity upon stimulation than those from healthy controls. Additionally, the magnitude of the IFN-I response to RIG-I stimulation was significantly associated with the severity of fatigue reported by the patients.

## Discussion

The results suggest that 'trained immunity'—a state where cells remain in high alert—may be a key driver of Long COVID pathophysiology. While the study is limited by specific cohort sizes, the results highlight the diagnostic potential of cellular response testing and the therapeutic potential of targeting the interferon pathway.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study concludes that Long COVID involves a hyperresponsive immune phenotype, establishing a biological link between immune activation and chronic fatigue. Future research is needed to evaluate whether inhibitors of this pathway can successfully treat the condition.

## Summary

This study represents a major step forward in validating a biological cause for ME/CFS by showing that a specific cellular defect—the "broken" TRPM3 ion channel—is consistently present in patients across different testing locations. Because these channels control how calcium enters cells to manage energy and immune responses, their failure helps explain the widespread exhaustion and immune issues seen in the illness. This research strengthens the case for using TRPM3 as an objective diagnostic tool and supports the continued investigation of drugs like naltrexone 💊, which previous studies suggest may help restore some of this channel's function. While more work is needed to turn this into a standard hospital test, the consistency of these findings provides a solid foundation for future clinical trials.

## What was researched?

This multi-site study sought to validate whether dysfunction in the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) ion channel is a consistent and reliable biological feature of ME/CFS. The researchers specifically examined the activity of these channels in natural killer (NK) cells to determine if the finding remains stable when tested across different laboratory environments by independent investigators.

## Why was it researched?

Previous research by this group has identified TRPM3 dysfunction as a hallmark of ME/CFS, but widespread clinical adoption of a biomarker requires "large-scale" validation to ensure the results are not due to local laboratory conditions or small sample sizes. Establishing TRPM3 as a consistent biomarker is a critical step toward developing a formal diagnostic test and identifying specific biological targets for future treatments.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a multi-site investigation using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, a highly precise technique for measuring electrical currents in individual cells. They analyzed isolated natural killer (NK) cells from 36 ME/CFS patients (diagnosed using the Canadian Consensus Criteria) and 42 healthy controls. The experiments were performed at two distinct laboratory sites to assess whether geographical or procedural differences would affect the detection of the ion channel dysfunction.

## What has been found?

The study confirmed a significant reduction in TRPM3 ion channel function in the NK cells of ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls across all measured parameters. Crucially, the results were consistent across both laboratory sites, proving that the dysfunction is a stable biological trait of the disease rather than a localized finding. These results suggest that TRPM3-mediated calcium signaling is fundamentally impaired in ME/CFS patients, reinforcing its potential as a robust diagnostic biomarker.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the lack of site-specific differences provides strong evidence for the reliability of TRPM3 testing in ME/CFS. They discuss how this ion channel dysfunction likely contributes to the broader systemic symptoms of the disease by disrupting calcium-dependent processes in various tissues. A potential limitation of the study is the specialized nature of patch-clamp technology, which currently requires high levels of expertise and may limit its immediate accessibility in standard clinical settings.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that TRPM3 ion channel dysfunction is a core component of the pathomechanism of ME/CFS and offers a viable pathway for objective diagnosis. Future research will likely focus on large-scale clinical trials of substances that interact with this channel and further investigation into how these cellular defects correlate with specific patient symptoms.

## Summary

This research represents a pivotal shift toward large-scale, collaborative efforts to solve the mystery of post-infectious syndromes. By comparing ME/CFS and Long Covid side-by-side using the latest molecular technology, the study treats these conditions as part of a broader biological spectrum rather than isolated phenomena. For patients, this means that the massive influx of research interest in Long Covid is being directly applied to ME/CFS, potentially speeding up the discovery of the first objective diagnostic tests. While this is a long-term project, its comprehensive design and high-level institutional support provide a solid foundation for finding actionable treatment targets in the coming years.

## What was researched?

This project, named the Rosetta Stone study, investigates the immunological similarities and differences between ME/CFS and Long Covid. Researchers aim to create a comprehensive cellular and molecular profile of both conditions to identify shared biological pathways and potential diagnostic biomarkers.

## Why was it researched?

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have observed significant clinical and pathological overlaps between ME/CFS and Long Covid, both of which are often triggered by viral infections. Despite these similarities, the underlying immune mechanisms are not fully understood, and there is a critical need for objective diagnostic tools and targeted treatments for both patient populations.

## How was it researched?

This is a three-year, large-scale biomedical study led by Imperial College London in collaboration with multiple UK institutions. The researchers will perform a direct side-by-side comparison of 250 individuals with ME/CFS and 250 individuals with Long Covid, alongside matched healthy controls. The team will analyze blood, stool, and saliva samples using high-resolution molecular techniques and incorporate symptom data collected through the ELAROS smartphone app. The study also leverages genetic data and expertise from existing cohorts, including the DecodeME study and the NIHR WILCO Long Covid study.

## What has been found?

As this announcement marks the launch of the project, the primary "finding" highlighted by the investigators is the established clinical evidence of significant overlap between the two conditions, justifying the largest-ever single investment in ME/CFS biomedical research by a UK charity. The study's design acknowledges that studying these conditions in parallel is the most effective way to uncover the "Rosetta Stone"—a shared biological key—that could explain the mechanisms of post-infectious disability.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that the study's primary strength is its unprecedented scale and its multi-sample approach, which allows for a holistic view of the immune system. They discuss the necessity of this large-scale collaboration to overcome the limitations of smaller, isolated studies that have historically struggled to provide definitive answers for ME/CFS. A potential challenge noted is the complexity of analyzing such a vast amount of data across different biological samples and diverse patient groups.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that mapping the immunological profiles of ME/CFS and Long Covid in tandem is essential for accelerating the development of medical solutions. Future work over the next three years will focus on identifying specific biomarkers and shared pathways that can inform subsequent clinical trials and therapeutic strategies.

## Summary

This research adds to the growing body of evidence that the "gut-brain axis" is central to ME/CFS. By identifying a specific lack of short-chain fatty acids—which act as fuel for the gut lining and regulate the immune system—the study provides a potential biological explanation for the systemic inflammation often seen in patients. While it does not offer a cure, it identifies measurable biomarkers that could eventually lead to objective diagnostic tools. Most importantly for patients, it suggests that dietary choices, specifically increasing fiber, might help support the microbiome's production of protective metabolites, though more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic benefits.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the differences in the composition of gut bacteria and the levels of their metabolic byproducts, specifically short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in people with ME/CFS. Researchers looked for links between these biological markers, the severity of fatigue, and the patients' intake of dietary fiber.

## Why was it researched?

While many ME/CFS patients report gastrointestinal issues, the exact relationship between gut "dysbiosis" (an imbalance of bacteria) and the disease's symptoms remains poorly understood. This research aimed to fill knowledge gaps by exploring whether a deficiency in specific health-promoting metabolites like SCFAs—which help maintain the gut barrier—is a core feature of the illness and how diet might influence this.

## How was it researched?

This was a case-control study involving 80 participants: 40 ME/CFS patients and 40 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. The researchers analyzed stool samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify bacterial types and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to measure the concentration of six different short-chain fatty acids. Statistical models were used to correlate these biological findings with clinical fatigue scores (FSS and FS-14) and dietary habits.

## What has been found?

The study found that ME/CFS patients have significantly lower bacterial diversity and a distinct "signature" of missing beneficial bacteria, particularly from the *Rikenellaceae* and *Ruminococcaceae* families. Crucially, patients had significantly lower levels of four key SCFAs: acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate. The reduction in these metabolites was directly linked to higher fatigue severity and lower quality of life scores. Additionally, patients who consumed a high-fiber diet 💊 had significantly higher levels of acetate and isovalerate compared to those on a low-fiber diet.

## Discussion

The authors suggest that the depletion of SCFA-producing bacteria leads to a "functional deficiency" that may weaken the intestinal barrier, potentially allowing inflammatory substances to enter the bloodstream and trigger systemic symptoms. They acknowledge that while the associations are strong, the study's cross-sectional nature cannot definitively prove that gut changes *cause* ME/CFS. They also highlight that dietary interventions appear to influence these metabolic levels, suggesting a potential pathway for symptom management.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The research concludes that gut dysbiosis and the resulting lack of short-chain fatty acids are significant pathological features of ME/CFS that correlate with symptom severity. The authors call for future longitudinal studies and clinical trials to determine if targeted interventions, such as high-fiber diets or specific prebiotics and probiotics, can effectively restore gut health and alleviate fatigue in this patient population.

## Summary

This research provides a detailed biological map of Long COVID, moving the scientific understanding toward a model of persistent immune system overdrive. By identifying specific pathways like JAK-STAT, the study offers immediate targets for clinical trials and provides patients with concrete evidence of biological dysfunction. This work helps validate the physical basis of the condition and suggests a shift in treatment strategies toward immune-modulating therapies rather than just antivirals.

## What was researched?

This study examined the biological mechanisms of Long COVID by investigating immune system changes, protein levels, and the presence of residual virus in patients months after their initial infection.

## Why was it researched?

Researchers aimed to understand why symptoms persist in some individuals and to identify specific biological signatures that could lead to diagnostic tests or effective treatments.

## How was it researched?

The team performed multi-omic analysis—combining genetic, protein, and viral data—on a cohort of 142 individuals and validated their findings in a second independent group. Participants included those with Long COVID, those who fully recovered, and uninfected controls.

## What has been found?

Long COVID patients showed persistent activation of the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways and signs of T-cell exhaustion more than 180 days after infection. While no active viral replication was detected, higher levels of inflammation during the initial acute infection were found to predict the later development of Long COVID.

## Discussion

The findings suggest that Long COVID is driven by a state of chronic immune dysregulation and exhaustion rather than a lingering active virus. This suggests that treatments targeting specific inflammatory pathways, such as JAK1 inhibitors 💊 like abrocitinib, may be more effective than antiviral medications.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The study identifies chronic inflammation and immune exhaustion as central drivers of Long COVID. It highlights the potential for using early immune markers to predict risk and for repurposing anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment.

## Summary

This study identifies a distinct metabolic signature in Long COVID patients, where the body relies on inefficient carbohydrate burning even at rest. This finding offers a biological explanation for post-exertional malaise and fatigue, moving the understanding of the condition beyond simple deconditioning. It suggests that metabolic inflexibility could be a valuable diagnostic marker for clinicians to identify the physiological roots of patient symptoms.

## What was researched?

The study investigated whether abnormal energy metabolism and substrate utilization—specifically the preference for burning carbohydrates over fat—are linked to symptom severity in patients with Long COVID.

## Why was it researched?

While fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) are hallmark symptoms of Long COVID, standard exercise tests often show normal cardiovascular results, necessitating a look at metabolic efficiency at the cellular level.

## How was it researched?

Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study of 50 Long COVID patients and 45 controls using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on a cycle ergometer. Indirect calorimetry was used to calculate the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) to determine how much fat versus carbohydrate was used for energy at rest and during exertion.

## What has been found?

The study found that 73% of Long COVID patients relied primarily on carbohydrates for energy at rest, compared to only 20% of healthy controls. Higher carbohydrate usage was significantly associated with severe fatigue and severe PEM, even though traditional metrics like peak oxygen uptake (VO2) were similar between groups.

## Discussion

A major strength is the discovery of a metabolic pattern that correlates directly with patient-reported symptom severity like PEM. However, as a cross-sectional preprint, the study cannot yet confirm if this metabolic shift is the cause or a consequence of Long COVID, and larger longitudinal trials are needed.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Long COVID patients exhibit inefficient energy consumption that serves as a metabolic signature of the disease. This pattern provides a potential diagnostic feature to better categorize and manage patients suffering from severe fatigue and PEM.

## Summary

This research is significant because it provides a "map" of how different biological problems in ME/CFS connect to one another. By showing that energy failures in cells, immature immune profiles, and blood vessel issues coexist, it offers a more comprehensive explanation for why patients experience such a wide range of debilitating symptoms. The identification of a specific set of biological markers is a major step toward developing an objective blood test for diagnosis. While no new treatments were tested in this specific study, the results help narrow down exactly where future drugs need to intervene to restore normal cellular and vascular function.

## What was researched?

This study conducted a multi-system analysis to investigate how energy metabolism, immune system function, and blood vessel (vascular) health are simultaneously affected in individuals with ME/CFS. The goal was to identify coordinated biological patterns that could explain the disease’s complex symptoms and provide a basis for new diagnostic tools.

## Why was it researched?

While many studies have examined single biological issues in ME/CFS—such as mitochondrial dysfunction or immune abnormalities—few have looked at how these systems interact within the same group of patients. Because ME/CFS affects multiple organs and systems, the researchers hypothesized that a "multi-omics" approach (looking at metabolites, proteins, and cells at once) would reveal a more complete picture of the disease's underlying biology.

## How was it researched?

This was a multimodal clinical study involving 61 ME/CFS patients (diagnosed using established clinical criteria) and 61 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The researchers analyzed blood samples using three primary methods: metabolomics to measure energy molecules like ATP, flow cytometry to profile immune cell maturity, and proteomics to identify plasma proteins related to vascular health. They then used a machine-learning technique called "classification and regression tree" (CART) modeling to determine which biological markers could most accurately distinguish patients from healthy individuals.

## What has been found?

The study found evidence of significant "energy stress" in the immune cells of ME/CFS patients, characterized by high levels of AMP and ADP and a reduced ATP/ADP ratio, indicating a struggle to generate cellular energy. The immune system showed a skewing toward less mature versions of T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, suggesting an impaired immune response. Furthermore, plasma analysis revealed elevated proteins associated with thrombus (blood clot) formation and vascular reactivity, which point toward endothelial dysfunction (problems with the lining of the blood vessels). The researchers identified a set of seven key biological variables that could potentially predict ME/CFS with high accuracy.

## Discussion

The authors emphasize that ME/CFS is a multi-system disorder where metabolic, immune, and vascular dysfunctions are likely linked. They note that the energy deficit in immune cells may be driven by mitochondrial issues, such as increased mitochondrial fission, while the vascular findings align with patient reports of "brain fog" and poor circulation. A primary limitation is the need for these findings to be validated in even larger, independent groups of patients to ensure the predictive model is reliable for clinical use.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that ME/CFS involves a coordinated breakdown across energy, immune, and vascular systems rather than a single isolated defect. They suggest that future treatments should likely target all three areas simultaneously to be effective. Future research will focus on validating the seven-variable diagnostic model and investigating whether these biological signatures change over the course of the illness.

## Summary

This research identifies a distinct genetic and inflammatory signature in a subset of ME/CFS patients involving the complement system. By linking specific genetic variants to protein levels, it provides a biological basis for the 'inflammatory subgroup' of the disease. These results could lead to more accurate diagnostic tests and targeted treatments for patients whose illness is driven by these specific immune pathways. The validation using UK Biobank data adds significant weight to the relevance of these findings for broader fatigue-related conditions.

## What was researched?

The study investigated whether genetic variants, specifically protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs), are associated with plasma complement protein levels in ME/CFS patients. It aimed to identify genetic drivers of immune dysregulation within the complement system to help explain patient heterogeneity.

## Why was it researched?

ME/CFS is a complex illness with unclear biological causes and significant patient variability. The researchers sought to understand the genetic basis of previous findings showing immune and complement system involvement in the disease to improve patient stratification.

## How was it researched?

Researchers performed pQTL analyses on a cohort of 50 ME/CFS patients and 121 non-fatigued controls to identify genetic variants associated with plasma complement protein levels. They analyzed 9,146 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and compared significant results with fatigue-related phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Statistical models were adjusted for relevant covariates to ensure the robustness of the genetic associations.

## What has been found?

The study identified 3,192 SNPs associated with complement proteins, including 11 variants previously linked to ME/CFS. A distinct patient subgroup was characterized by a 'high C3/low Bb' profile, indicating specific dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Six significant pQTLs were independently validated through their association with fatigue-related phenotypes in the UK Biobank database.

## Discussion

The findings highlight a genetic mechanism by which risk alleles contribute to the inflammatory diversity observed in ME/CFS. While the study identifies potential predictive markers like C3 and Factor B, the relatively small sample size necessitates further validation in larger cohorts. The integration of genetic and proteomic data is shown to be a powerful method for subtyping complex chronic illnesses.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The research establishes a genetic link to complement system dysregulation in a specific subgroup of ME/CFS patients. This discovery supports the use of pathway-focused subtyping to guide future personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the illness.

## Summary

This study provides a vital roadmap for improving the quality of clinical research for both Long COVID and ME/CFS. By emphasizing the need for objective and patient-relevant metrics, especially regarding post-exertional malaise, it aims to shift the scientific field away from flawed "one-size-fits-all" studies toward more precise and safe research. For patients, this means that future clinical trials are more likely to correctly identify treatments that work while avoiding protocols that could lead to post-exertional crashes.

## What was researched?

This paper establishes a framework for selecting and implementing "outcome measures"—the specific tools and scales used to determine if a treatment is working—in Long COVID clinical trials. The researchers focused specifically on how to accurately capture post-exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms after even minor exertion, which is often missed in standard medical studies.

## Why was it researched?

The research was prompted by the high failure rate and poor design of existing Long COVID clinical trials, which often rely on generic tools that fail to account for the core features of the illness. Without standardized, validated ways to measure symptoms like PEM and cognitive dysfunction, effective treatments cannot be properly identified, and some trial protocols may even risk harming patients by ignoring the danger of exertional triggers.

## How was it researched?

This was a comprehensive "Personal View" and expert review that synthesized current clinical challenges with patient-led research data. The authors—a team of clinicians, physical therapists, and patient-researchers—analyzed existing trial methodologies and developed five overarching recommendations for future research. They also curated a list of existing and candidate outcome measures specifically suited for tracking the fluctuating nature of Long COVID and ME/CFS symptoms over time.

## What has been found?

The authors identified five critical requirements for successful trials: thorough baseline characterization of patients, the collection of long-term longitudinal data, the use of placebo arms to account for the natural "waxing and waning" of the disease, the mandatory inclusion of PEM measurements, and the balancing of trial groups by disease severity and phenotype. They found that unless trials specifically measure PEM, they risk producing "false positives" or failing to detect real improvements in quality of life.

## Discussion

The authors discuss the limitations of current research, noting that many studies are too short or use overly broad definitions of "fatigue" that do not distinguish between tiredness and the systemic crash of PEM. They emphasize that the biological causes of Long COVID are likely diverse, meaning that trials must be designed to look at specific subgroups of patients rather than treating all participants as a single, uniform group.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The paper concludes that the development and validation of specific outcome measures must happen alongside the testing of new drugs to avoid wasting time and resources. Future work must focus on securing dedicated funding to validate these endpoints in large, diverse patient populations to ensure that clinical trials can accurately identify effective therapies.

## Summary

This study demonstrates that low-cost patient questionnaires, when analyzed with advanced machine learning, can objectively categorize the complex "umbrella" of Long COVID into specific biological subtypes (endotypes) and severity levels. By identifying ten global endotypes—including a severe, female-predominant cluster characterized by hormonal and neurological symptoms—the research provides a roadmap for personalizing treatments and clinical trials. The finding that acute phase severity significantly predicts the risk of developing severe Long COVID offers a vital window for early intervention. Furthermore, the correlation between symptom-based severity scores and active immune responses (plasmablast antibodies) validates that patient-reported data reflects underlying biological processes.

## What was researched?

The study aimed to determine if unsupervised machine learning (topic modeling) could identify distinct symptom clusters, biologically meaningful endotypes based on organ systems, and quantitative severity groups from standardized Long COVID patient questionnaires. It also investigated whether these symptom-based groupings correlated with clinical health status (EQ-5D) and molecular biomarkers like SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses.

## Why was it researched?

The extreme heterogeneity of Long COVID symptoms across multiple organ systems makes it challenging to design effective clinical trials or understand the condition's underlying mechanisms. While Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are often used for analysis, they suffer from missing data and lack of standardization; thus, the researchers sought to validate whether simpler, more accessible questionnaire data could provide a robust framework for patient stratification and precision medicine.

## How was it researched?

Researchers analyzed de-identified questionnaire data from four independent cohorts (UCSF, $n=669$; ISMMS, $n=615$; Emory, $n=60$; and Cardiff, $n=317$) totaling 1,661 participants. They employed a machine learning pipeline using Poisson Factor Analysis for topic modeling to reduce data dimensionality, followed by unsupervised clustering and hierarchical mapping of symptoms to organ systems. Validation was conducted by comparing symptom-based severity scores against EQ-5D health scores and immunological data, including MENSA (plasmablast) and serum antibody assays.

## What has been found?

The analysis identified ten global endotypes and three distinct severity levels (mild, moderate, and severe) that were consistent across different clinical sites. Key findings include:
* A specific severe cluster was identified that is predominantly female and characterized by neurological, hormonal, and temperature regulation symptoms.
* Three distinct symptom trajectories were discovered: "acute-resolving," "persistent but attenuated," and "progressive" (where symptoms like joint pain and concentration difficulties worsen over time).
* Patients with non-mild symptoms during the acute infection phase had a 2.6-fold higher risk of developing moderate or severe Long COVID.
* Symptom-based severity scores significantly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibodies 💊 from plasmablasts (MENSA), indicating an active immune response in more severe cases.

## Discussion

A significant strength of this study is the cross-cohort validation, showing that the machine learning approach is robust even when merging different datasets. The researchers noted that while traditional tools like PCA failed to identify clusters, topic modeling successfully captured the "co-occurrence" of symptoms. However, limitations include the stochastic nature of Poisson factorization, the lack of randomization in cohorts, and imbalanced gender distributions, which required sex-stratified analysis to ensure accuracy.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that machine learning-assisted screening of simple questionnaires can robustly identify Long COVID endotypes and severity, providing a framework for precision medicine trial design. Future work will focus on identifying group-specific biomarkers by linking these clusters to broader experimental data and conducting sex-stratified analyses of daily hormone levels to better understand sex-specific mechanisms of disease severity.
