## Summary

This study provides preliminary but highly encouraging evidence for H.E.L.P. apheresis as a treatment for Long COVID. The research supports the theory that persistent microclots and inflammation play a key role in the illness by demonstrating that physically filtering these components from the blood can lead to dramatic and lasting clinical improvements. For patients, this suggests a potential, tangible treatment that addresses an underlying biological mechanism, though it is still experimental and not widely available. The overwhelmingly positive results in this small group strongly justify the larger, controlled clinical trials needed to confirm these findings and potentially establish this as a standard of care.

## What was researched?

This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a blood filtration procedure called Heparin-mediated Extracorporeal Low-density lipoprotein Precipitation (H.E.L.P.) apheresis as a potential treatment for patients with severe, persistent Long COVID symptoms. The research aimed to assess if repeated treatments could lead to clinical recovery and long-term functional improvement.

## Why was it researched?

Long COVID is a debilitating condition with no proven effective treatments, and there is growing evidence that it may be caused by persistent, fibrinolysis-resistant microclots and systemic inflammation that block capillaries and impair oxygen transport to tissues. H.E.L.P. apheresis is a procedure known to remove clotting factors like fibrinogen, inflammatory mediators, and other pathological substances from the blood, making it a plausible therapeutic candidate to address the hypothesized underlying cause of Long COVID symptoms.

## How was it researched?

This was a retrospective pilot study (case series) involving 17 patients (ages 23-63) with a formal diagnosis of Long COVID and severe symptoms lasting 2-12 months. Each participant received between 1 to 7 sessions of H.E.L.P. apheresis. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated using questionnaires to assess symptoms before and after the treatment course, along with a 6-10 month telephonic follow-up. Blood tests for inflammatory and coagulation markers like fibrinogen, D-Dimer, and CRP were also conducted before and after treatments to monitor physiological changes.

## What has been found?

The treatment showed significant positive effects. Of the 17 patients, 16 experienced immediate and substantial improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. After completing their treatment course, 12 patients reported complete or near-complete resolution of all symptoms, returning to their pre-infection baseline. A follow-up at 6-10 months found that these benefits were maintained or had continued to improve in 15 of the patients. Only one patient did not experience symptomatic relief, although their blood oxygen saturation did improve.

## Discussion

The authors acknowledge that this was a small pilot study without a control group, which is a significant limitation. The lack of a control group was attributed to the high cost and limited availability of H.E.L.P. apheresis machines. They also noted that the optimal number of treatments required is still unknown and may depend on how long a patient has been ill. The authors hypothesize that the observed benefits are primarily due to the removal of circulating microclots and the restoration of normal clotting function and oxygen delivery.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that H.E.L.P. apheresis is a promising and safe treatment option that can significantly reduce clinical symptoms and improve long-term function in patients with Long COVID. They strongly emphasize the urgent need for larger, controlled studies to rigorously evaluate the procedure's efficacy and safety before it can be considered a standard treatment. Future research should also explore its potential use in acute severe COVID-19 and other post-viral illnesses with similar proposed mechanisms, such as ME/CFS.
