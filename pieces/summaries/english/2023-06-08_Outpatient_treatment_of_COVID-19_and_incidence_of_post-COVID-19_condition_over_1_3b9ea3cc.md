- **What was researched?**
This study investigated whether early outpatient treatment for acute COVID-19 with one of three medicationsâ€”metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamineâ€”could reduce the incidence of a subsequent diagnosis of post-COVID-19 condition (Long COVID) over a 10-month follow-up period.
- **Why was it researched?**
Long COVID is a significant and emerging public health crisis, yet few randomized trials have assessed whether early treatments for the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can prevent its long-term consequences. This research was motivated by the urgent need to find a safe, affordable, and globally available intervention to reduce the risk of developing this chronic condition.
- **How was it researched?**
This was a large, remote (decentralised), randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted in the USA. The study included 1,126 adults aged 30-85 with overweight or obesity who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms for less than a week. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either metformin ðŸ’Š, ivermectin, fluvoxamine, or a matching placebo, and were followed for up to 300 days to see if they received a Long COVID diagnosis from a medical provider.
- **What has been found?**
Early outpatient treatment with metformin ðŸ’Š significantly reduced the incidence of Long COVID. The cumulative incidence of a Long COVID diagnosis by day 300 was 6.3% in the metformin group compared to 10.4% in the placebo group, representing a 41% reduction in risk. The beneficial effect was even stronger when metformin was started within three days of symptom onset. In contrast, neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed any effect on reducing the incidence of Long COVID compared to placebo.
- **Discussion:**
The authors note that a major strength of the study is its randomized, quadruple-blind design, which limits potential bias. A limitation is the potential for selection bias, as trial participants may not represent the general population. The study also excluded adults with a normal BMI or those under 30, so it is unknown if the findings apply to these groups.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:**
The authors conclude that early outpatient treatment with metformin during an acute COVID-19 infection effectively reduces the risk of developing Long COVID. Fluvoxamine and ivermectin were not effective for this purpose. The researchers suggest future trials are needed to assess therapeutics for Long COVID prevention in other populations, including those who are vaccinated or have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infections.
- **Summary:**
This is a landmark study as it is the first large-scale randomized trial to show that an existing, safe, and low-cost medication can prevent Long COVID. The findings suggest that taking metformin ðŸ’Š early during a COVID-19 infection could cut the risk of developing long-term symptoms by over 40%. This provides a potential and immediately actionable strategy to mitigate the long-term public health burden of COVID-19, though further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness across different populations, such as those who are vaccinated or not overweight.
- **Simple Summary:**
Researchers tested three different drugs to see if taking them during a COVID-19 infection could prevent Long COVID. They found that metformin, a safe and inexpensive drug normally used for diabetes, significantly reduced the chance of getting Long COVID. The other two drugs tested, ivermectin and fluvoxamine, did not show any benefit.
