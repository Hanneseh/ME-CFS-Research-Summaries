## Summary

This review provides a compelling framework that connects the wide range of physical problems found in ME/CFS and Long COVID (such as immune dysfunction, mitochondrial issues, and viral persistence) to a central mechanism in the brain. It proposes that these different issues all contribute to brain inflammation, which in turn activates a primitive "sickness program" responsible for generating core symptoms like profound fatigue and cognitive difficulties. The illness persists because these biological problems create self-sustaining vicious cycles. This model suggests that future treatments aimed at calming brain inflammation could offer a powerful way to manage the symptoms for a broad range of patients.

## What was researched?

This review article explores how the various underlying biological abnormalities identified in both long COVID and ME/CFS lead to the illnesses' characteristic symptoms and why these symptoms persist for years. The authors propose that in addition to direct causes, symptoms may also arise from the activation of ancient, evolutionarily conserved responses to vital threats, specifically "sickness behavior" and "torpor," which are mediated by specific neural circuits.

## Why was it researched?

While many biological abnormalities (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, autoantibodies) have been found in both long COVID and ME/CFS, the precise mechanisms linking these issues to the generation and chronicity of symptoms remain unclear. This review aims to synthesize recent discoveries to explain how these diverse pathologies might converge on a common pathway in the brain, offering a more unified understanding of the diseases.

## How was it researched?

This paper is a literature review. The authors synthesized and analyzed findings from numerous existing research articles on long COVID, ME/CFS, immunology, and neuroscience. They used this evidence to construct a comprehensive model explaining how neuroinflammation, triggered by various peripheral abnormalities, could activate specific neural circuits in the brain to produce a stereotyped set of sickness symptoms and metabolic changes.

## What has been found?

The authors argue that symptoms are caused both directly by various pathologies and indirectly through a central mechanism: neuroinflammation. This neuroinflammation, triggered by factors like persistent viral antigens or gut dysbiosis, is proposed to stimulate newly discovered neural circuits in the brainstem and hypothalamus. These circuits then orchestrate evolutionarily ancient, energy-preserving responses known as "sickness behavior" and a "torpor-like" hypometabolic state, manifesting as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and malaise. The illness becomes chronic due to persistent triggers (like viral reservoirs) and the creation of self-perpetuating "vicious cycles," where different biological abnormalities reinforce one another.

## Discussion

The authors propose that a "single lesion" is unlikely to be the sole cause of these complex illnesses. Their model's strength lies in providing a unifying explanation where diverse peripheral issues converge on a central symptom-generating pathway in the brain. They suggest that while targeting each individual abnormality is a valid therapeutic approach, it may be more effective to target the central driver of neuroinflammation that activates these sickness-mediating neural circuits.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that the symptoms and metabolic changes in long COVID and ME/CFS are likely driven by neuroinflammation activating specific brain circuits that control sickness behavior. The chronicity is maintained by persistent triggers and interlocking "vicious cycles" of pathology. They suggest that future therapeutic strategies should focus on developing novel treatments that can precisely quell neuroinflammation, which may alleviate many of the core symptoms of these illnesses.
