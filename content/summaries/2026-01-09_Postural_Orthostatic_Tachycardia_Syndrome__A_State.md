## Summary

This comprehensive review consolidates the current medical understanding of POTS, emphasizing its role as a complex, multi-system autonomic disorder rather than just a cardiac issue. It highlights the urgent need for specialized multidisciplinary care teams to address the significant diagnostic delays and the broad symptom burden that severely impacts patient quality of life.

## What was researched?

The researchers conducted a state-of-the-art review to synthesize current knowledge on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).

## Why was it researched?

POTS is frequently misunderstood or missed by healthcare professionals, leading to significant diagnostic delays for a condition that causes profound functional impairment and often follows viral infections like COVID-19.

## How was it researched?

The authors performed a narrative review of existing clinical literature and expert consensus to outline the best practices for diagnosis using orthostatic challenge tests and contemporary treatment strategies.

## What has been found?

The review identifies POTS as a highly heterogeneous condition with multifaceted origins, including autoimmune, hyperadrenergic, and neuropathic components. Effective management requires a combination of non-pharmacologic lifestyle changes and pharmacologic interventions such as ivabradine 💊, though many current treatments offer only modest relief.

## Discussion

A major challenge identified is the severe shortage of medical specialists trained in autonomic medicine, which limits patient access to necessary long-term follow-up and monitoring. The complexity of the syndrome necessitates a primary care team supported by specialist nurses and allied health professionals.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that a multidisciplinary approach is essential for managing POTS effectively. They call for increased research funding and a larger workforce of specialized investigators to better understand the disease's etiology and develop more effective therapies.
