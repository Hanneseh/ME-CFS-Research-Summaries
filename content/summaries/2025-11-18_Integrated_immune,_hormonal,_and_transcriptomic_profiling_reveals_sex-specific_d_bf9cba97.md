## Summary

This comprehensive study provides biological validation for the severe symptoms reported by ME/CFS patients and elucidates why the condition presents differently in males and females. It links specific immune abnormalities, such as gut leakiness and neuroinflammation, directly to hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone in women and low cortisol in both sexes. The identification of neuroinflammatory gene signatures in females offers a potential explanation for cognitive dysfunction ("brain fog"). Importantly, these findings propose a concrete, testable path for treatment: regulating sex hormones and cortisol levels to help restore immune homeostasis.

## What was researched?

This study investigated the biological differences between male and female Long COVID (LC) patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The researchers utilized a multi-omics approach to profile immune cell phenotypes, hormone levels, and gene expression patterns to identify sex-specific mechanisms driving the disease.

## Why was it researched?

Females are disproportionately affected by LC and ME/CFS, comprising approximately 70% of cases, yet the biological reasons for this disparity remain unclear. While sex differences in acute COVID-19 are well-documented, less is known about how sex influences the chronic phase of the disease. The authors aimed to uncover specific immune and hormonal dysregulations that could explain why females are more susceptible and to identify potential targets for personalized, sex-specific treatments.

## How was it researched?

The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study involving 78 LC patients with ME/CFS (58 females and 20 males) and 62 age- and sex-matched recovered controls who had COVID-19 but did not develop long-term symptoms. They analyzed blood samples using flow cytometry to count immune cells, multiplex ELISAs to measure cytokines, chemokines, and hormones, and bulk RNA sequencing to examine gene expression. The study specifically correlated these biological markers with clinical symptoms like fatigue and cognitive impairment.

## What has been found?

The study identified distinct biological signatures for males and females.  Female patients (LCF) exhibited a "shift toward myelopoiesis," characterized by increased neutrophils and monocytes, reduced lymphocytes, and depleted regulatory T cells (Tregs), indicating persistent immune activation. Females also showed elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells (immature red blood cells), markers of gut barrier dysfunction (I-FABP, LPS-BP), and a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Hormonally, females had significantly reduced testosterone, while males had reduced estradiol; notably, cortisol levels were low in both sexes [cite: 58, 208-210]. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that females had upregulated genes associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction (e.g., *ZNF469*, *BRINP2*, *Reln*), which correlated with "brain fog" symptoms [cite: 416-418, 493]. Males showed a different profile with less severe inflammation and gene expression related to cellular stress and tissue repair.

## Discussion

The authors discuss how the reduced levels of sex hormones (testosterone in females, estradiol in males) and cortisol likely contribute to the observed immune dysregulation, as these hormones typically have anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory roles.  They highlight that the elevated gut leakage markers in females suggest microbial translocation may be driving systemic inflammation specifically in that group. The study acknowledges limitations, including unequal sample sizes between sexes and the cross-sectional design, which prevents tracking changes over time.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The researchers conclude that LC with ME/CFS is a multifaceted disease with profound sex-specific differences, where females experience more severe inflammation and neuro-immune dysregulation. They suggest that correcting hormonal imbalances—specifically considering hormone replacement therapy to restore testosterone in females and estradiol in males—could be a potential therapeutic strategy. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the causal role of these hormonal pathways.
