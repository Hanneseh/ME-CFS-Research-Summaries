## Summary

This study investigated a blood-filtering treatment called Immunoadsorption to remove potentially harmful autoantibodies in 10 patients with post-COVID ME/CFS. A promising 7 out of 10 patients experienced a significant improvement in their physical function four weeks after treatment, though their reported fatigue levels did not change. This finding supports the idea that the immune system, and specifically these autoantibodies, may contribute to the disease in some individuals. While these early results are encouraging, this was a small, uncontrolled study, and the treatment itself was physically demanding for patients. The study serves as a critical stepping stone, providing the necessary evidence to launch larger, placebo-controlled trials to confirm the treatment's effectiveness.

## What was researched?

This observational study evaluated the efficacy of a treatment called Immunoadsorption (IA) for patients who developed ME/CFS after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary goal was to assess whether this treatment could improve the physical and functional ability of patients who had elevated levels of specific autoantibodies (ß2-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies). This paper presents the interim results from the first ten patients treated in the study.

## Why was it researched?

There is increasing evidence that ME/CFS, particularly after an infection, may have an autoimmune basis. Previous small studies suggested that IA, a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood, was effective in post-infectious ME/CFS. Since autoantibodies against ß2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2 AABs) have been linked to symptom severity in post-COVID ME/CFS, the researchers hypothesized that removing these autoantibodies with IA could be a promising therapeutic approach for this patient group.

## How was it researched?

This was a prospective observational study involving ten patients diagnosed with post-COVID ME/CFS who also had elevated ADRB2 autoantibodies. Each patient underwent five sessions of Immunoadsorption (IA) over a ten-day period, a procedure that filters immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the blood plasma. The main outcome was the change in physical function, measured using the SF-36 Physical Function (SF36-PF) questionnaire, assessed four weeks after the treatment. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, and cognitive issues, were also evaluated using standardized scales.

## What has been found?

Four weeks after treatment, seven of the ten patients showed a clinically significant improvement in physical function, with their SF36-PF scores increasing by 10 to 45 points. This improvement was accompanied by a significant reduction in muscle pain and immune-related symptoms in these "responders". Although IA successfully lowered the levels of the targeted autoantibodies in all patients, these levels began to rise again within four weeks. Interestingly, there was no significant change in fatigue scores, and the degree of clinical improvement did not correlate with the reduction in autoantibody levels.

## Discussion

The authors highlight that the study's primary limitations are the small number of patients and the lack of a control group. They suggest that the observed benefits may not be solely due to the removal of autoantibodies, as there was no correlation between antibody levels and patient response; other mechanisms, such as effects on the B cells that produce antibodies, might be involved. The authors also note that fatigue often improves later in the recovery process, which might explain why physical function improved while fatigue scores did not.

## Conclusion & Future Work

The authors conclude that these preliminary results provide evidence that Immunoadsorption has efficacy in a subset of patients with post-COVID ME/CFS, supporting the theory that autoantibodies play a role in the disease mechanism. These findings justify moving forward with larger, more definitive studies, including a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sham (placebo) apheresis group and an RCT that combines IA with a B-cell depleting therapy. The study also plans to investigate if repeat IA treatments can lead to longer-lasting remission in patients who initially respond but later decline.
